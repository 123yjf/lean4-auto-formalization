-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Evaluate the operation star_op defined on rationals by star_op a b = (1/b − 1/a) / (a − b) at a = 3 and b = 11, and show that the result equals 1/33.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Substitute a = 3 and b = 11 into the definition and simplify the rational expression step by step: compute the numerator 1/11 − 1/3, compute the denominator 3 − 11, and then divide.
-- 3. [Proof] By definition, star_op 3 11 = (1/11 − 1/3) / (3 − 11).
   Compute the numerator: 1/11 − 1/3 = (3 − 11) / 33 = −8/33.
   Compute the denominator: 3 − 11 = −8.
   Divide: (−8/33) / (−8) = (−8/33) · (−1/8) = 1/33.
   Thus star_op 3 11 = 1/33. In the Lean code, this is done by unfolding the definition (unfold star_op) and letting norm_num perform the arithmetic simplification. The final theorem simply cites this lemma.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The value of star_op (3 : ℚ) 11 is 1/33.
