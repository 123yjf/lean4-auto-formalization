-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exists exactly one rational number x such that
--    2 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 144/53.

-- 2. [Key Idea] Prove existence by directly substituting a candidate value x = 3/4 and calculating the nested rational expression. Prove uniqueness by showing that any rational y satisfying the same equation must equal 3/4. Conceptually, uniqueness comes from inverting the nested expression step by step (each denominator is nonzero), which forces a single value for x.

-- 3. [Proof]
--    Existence: Take x = 3/4. A direct computation of the nested expression at this x (carried out in the lemma named direct_calculation) gives
--    2 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + 3/4))) = 144/53.
--    Hence a solution exists.

--    Uniqueness: Let y be any rational number satisfying
--    2 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + y))) = 144/53.
--    The lemma uniqueness_result states that any such y must equal 3/4. Therefore, no other rational value can satisfy the equation.

-- 4. [Conclusion] There exists exactly one rational number solving the equation, namely x = 3/4.
