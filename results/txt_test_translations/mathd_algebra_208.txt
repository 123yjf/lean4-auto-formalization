-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that sqrt(1,000,000) − (1,000,000)^(1/3) = 900 over the real numbers.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Rewrite 1,000,000 as 10^6. Then compute the square root and cube root using exponent rules for nonnegative bases: sqrt(10^6) = 10^3 and (10^6)^(1/3) = 10^2. The difference is 10^3 − 10^2 = 900.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    a) Note that 1,000,000 = 10^6.
--    b) For the square root: sqrt(10^6) = sqrt((10^3)^2) = |10^3| = 10^3, since 10^3 ≥ 0.
--    c) For the cube root: with base 10 > 0, (10^6)^(1/3) = 10^(6·(1/3)) = 10^2.
--    d) Compute the difference: 10^3 − 10^2 = 1000 − 100 = 900.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, sqrt(1,000,000) − (1,000,000)^(1/3) = 900.
