-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For all real numbers a, prove that sqrt(4 + sqrt(16 + 16a)) + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)) = 6 if and only if a = 8.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Show that the first radical simplifies to twice the second one: sqrt(4 + sqrt(16 + 16a)) = 2·sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)). Then the given equation becomes 3·t = 6 with t = sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)), so t = 2. From there, square step by step (justified by nonnegativity) to solve back to a = 8. The reverse direction is a direct evaluation at a = 8.
-- 3. [Proof] 
- Forward direction (⇒):
  Assume sqrt(4 + sqrt(16 + 16a)) + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)) = 6.
  First, we show a ≥ -1. Suppose instead a < -1. Then 1 + a ≤ 0, so sqrt(1 + a) = 0, hence sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)) = sqrt(1) = 1. Also 16 + 16a ≤ 0, so sqrt(16 + 16a) = 0 and therefore sqrt(4 + sqrt(16 + 16a)) = sqrt(4) = 2. Plugging into the equation gives 2 + 1 = 6, a contradiction. Thus a ≥ -1.
  Next, factor the first term. Since a ≥ -1, we have 1 + a ≥ 0, so:
    sqrt(16 + 16a) = sqrt(16(1 + a)) = 4·sqrt(1 + a).
  Therefore:
    sqrt(4 + sqrt(16 + 16a)) = sqrt(4 + 4·sqrt(1 + a)) = sqrt(4(1 + sqrt(1 + a))) = 2·sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)).
  Let t = sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)). Then the original equation becomes 2t + t = 6, i.e., 3t = 6, hence t = 2.
  Now solve back. Since t = sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)) = 2 and 1 + sqrt(1 + a) ≥ 0, squaring gives 1 + sqrt(1 + a) = 4, so sqrt(1 + a) = 3. Again, with 1 + a ≥ 0, squaring yields 1 + a = 9, hence a = 8.
- Reverse direction (⇐):
  Assume a = 8. Compute:
    sqrt(16 + 16·8) = sqrt(144) = 12,
    sqrt(1 + 8) = sqrt(9) = 3,
    sqrt(4 + 12) = sqrt(16) = 4,
    sqrt(1 + 3) = sqrt(4) = 2.
  Therefore sqrt(4 + sqrt(16 + 16a)) + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)) = 4 + 2 = 6.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The equation sqrt(4 + sqrt(16 + 16a)) + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + a)) = 6 holds exactly when a = 8.
