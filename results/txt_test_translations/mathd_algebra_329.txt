-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exist real numbers x and y such that line1 x y and line2 x y both hold and, moreover, x + y = 4. Here line1 x y means 3*y = x, and line2 x y means 2*x + 5*y = 11.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Exhibit a concrete solution (x, y) = (3, 1) and verify all three conditions directly by computation.
-- 3. [Proof] Take x = 3 and y = 1. Then:
--    - For line1: 3*y = 3*1 = 3, which equals x, so line1 holds.
--    - For line2: 2*x + 5*y = 2*3 + 5*1 = 6 + 5 = 11, so line2 holds.
--    - For the sum: x + y = 3 + 1 = 4.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, there exist real numbers x and y (namely x = 3, y = 1) satisfying line1, line2, and x + y = 4.
