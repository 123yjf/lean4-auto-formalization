-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For a positive real number r, suppose x is any real number with x = r^(1/3) and x + 1/x = 3. Prove that r^3 + 1/r^3 = 5778.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the identities (t + 1/t)^3 = (t^3 + 1/t^3) + 3(t + 1/t) and, analogously, (u + 1/u)^3 = (u^3 + 1/u^3) + 3(u + 1/u). From x + 1/x = 3, deduce x^3 + 1/x^3 = 18, then from that obtain x^9 + 1/x^9 = 5778. Finally, relate x and r via x = r^(1/3) to show x^9 = r^3, which yields the desired result. Positivity of r ensures x > 0, so divisions are valid.
-- 3. [Proof] Since r > 0 and x = r^(1/3), we have x > 0, so 1/x is well-defined and nonzero. Expand (x + 1/x)^3 to get (x^3 + 1/x^3) + 3(x + 1/x). Substituting x + 1/x = 3 gives 27 = (x^3 + 1/x^3) + 9, hence x^3 + 1/x^3 = 18. Now apply the same cubic identity to x^3: (x^3 + 1/x^3)^3 = (x^9 + 1/x^9) + 3(x^3 + 1/x^3). With x^3 + 1/x^3 = 18, this becomes 18^3 = (x^9 + 1/x^9) + 54, so x^9 + 1/x^9 = 18^3 − 54 = 5832 − 54 = 5778. Because x = r^(1/3) with r > 0, we have x^3 = r and thus x^9 = r^3. Therefore r^3 + 1/r^3 = x^9 + 1/x^9 = 5778.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Under the assumptions x = r^(1/3) and x + 1/x = 3 with r > 0, it follows that r^3 + 1/r^3 = 5778.
