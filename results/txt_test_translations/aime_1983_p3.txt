-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the product of the real roots of the equation x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2·sqrt(x^2 + 18x + 45).

-- 2. [Key Idea] Complete the square: x^2 + 18x = (x + 9)^2 − 81. Then
--    x^2 + 18x + 30 = (x + 9)^2 − 51 and x^2 + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)^2 − 36.
--    Let u = (x + 9)^2. The equation becomes u − 51 = 2·sqrt(u − 36), which forces u ≥ 36.
--    Setting v = sqrt(u − 36) ≥ 0 yields v^2 − 2v − 15 = 0, so v ∈ {5, −3}; by v ≥ 0 we must have v = 5.
--    Hence u = v^2 + 36 = 61, so (x + 9)^2 = 61 and x = −9 ± sqrt(61). Their product is (−9)^2 − (sqrt(61))^2 = 81 − 61 = 20.

-- 3. [Proof] 
--    First, complete the square explicitly:
--    For any real x, x^2 + 18x + 30 = (x + 9)^2 − 51 and x^2 + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)^2 − 36.
--    Now take x₁ = −9 + sqrt(61) and x₂ = −9 − sqrt(61). Then x₁ + 9 = sqrt(61) and x₂ + 9 = −sqrt(61), so in both cases (xᵢ + 9)^2 = 61.
--    Substituting into the completed-square forms gives:
--    xᵢ^2 + 18xᵢ + 30 = 61 − 51 = 10 and xᵢ^2 + 18xᵢ + 45 = 61 − 36 = 25.
--    Therefore sqrt(xᵢ^2 + 18xᵢ + 45) = sqrt(25) = 5, and indeed
--    xᵢ^2 + 18xᵢ + 30 = 10 = 2·5 = 2·sqrt(xᵢ^2 + 18xᵢ + 45),
--    so both x₁ and x₂ satisfy the given equation.
--    To compute their product, use the difference of squares:
--    x₁·x₂ = (−9 + sqrt(61))(−9 − sqrt(61)) = (−9)^2 − (sqrt(61))^2 = 81 − 61 = 20.
--    Moreover, the substitution step v = sqrt((x + 9)^2 − 36) shows v must satisfy v^2 − 2v − 15 = 0 with v ≥ 0, hence v = 5 is the only possibility. This forces (x + 9)^2 = 61, so the only real solutions are exactly x = −9 ± sqrt(61), whose product we just computed.

-- 4. [Conclusion] The real roots are −9 ± sqrt(61), and their product is 20.
