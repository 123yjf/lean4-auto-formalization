-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Define f(x) = 12x + 7, g(x) = 5x + 2, and h(x) = gcd(f(x), g(x)). Prove the conjunction of:
--    (i) For every natural number x > 0, h(x) = 1 or h(x) = 11.
--    (ii) There exists x > 0 with h(x) = 1.
--    (iii) There exists x > 0 with h(x) = 11.
--    (iv) 1 + 11 = 12.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Show that h(x) divides 11 by exhibiting a linear combination of f(x) and g(x) that equals 11. Since 11 is prime, any positive divisor of 11 is 1 or 11, giving the dichotomy for h(x). Then provide explicit x to realize each case, and verify the simple sum.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    (i) Fix x > 0. Note the identity 5·(12x + 7) = 12·(5x + 2) + 11. Since h(x) = gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2), we have h(x) divides 12x + 7 and h(x) divides 5x + 2. Hence h(x) divides 5·(12x + 7) and h(x) divides 12·(5x + 2). Subtracting these multiples, h(x) divides 11. Because 11 is prime, the only positive divisors of 11 are 1 and 11, so h(x) = 1 or h(x) = 11.
--    (ii) Take x = 1. Then f(1) = 19 and g(1) = 7, so h(1) = gcd(19, 7) = 1. Also, 1 > 0.
--    (iii) Take x = 4. Then f(4) = 55 and g(4) = 22, so h(4) = gcd(55, 22) = 11. Also, 4 > 0.
--    (iv) Finally, 1 + 11 = 12.
-- 4. [Conclusion] For all x > 0, gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) equals 1 or 11; there exist positive x attaining each value (x = 1 for 1, x = 4 for 11); and 1 + 11 = 12.
