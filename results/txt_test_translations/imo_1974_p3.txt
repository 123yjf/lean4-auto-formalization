-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We define an integer sequence d : ℕ → ℤ by d 0 = 0, d 1 = 4, d 2 = 8, and for all m, d (m + 3) = 2 d (m + 2) + 7 d (m + 1). We then:
--    - Verify the defining values for d 1, d 2, and the recursive expression for d 3.
--    - Compute d 3 = 44 and d 4 = 144.
--    - Show that 5 does not divide d 1 and 5 does not divide d 3.
--    - Conclude that for any m in the list [1, 3], 5 does not divide d m.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Unfold the definition of d to obtain the base values and recurrence, then perform straightforward arithmetic to compute d 3 and d 4. For the divisibility claims, evaluate d 1 and d 3 explicitly and check they are not multiples of 5. For the final statement over [1, 3], use that membership in the list [1, 3] means m = 1 or m = 3, and handle each case with the previously proved non-divisibility.
-- 3. [Proof]
--    - By the definition of d, we immediately have d 1 = 4 and d 2 = 8. Likewise, the recurrence at index 0 gives d 3 = 2 d 2 + 7 d 1.
--    - Substituting the base values, d 3 = 2·8 + 7·4 = 16 + 28 = 44.
--    - Applying the recurrence at index 1 gives d 4 = 2 d 3 + 7 d 2; substituting the computed values yields d 4 = 2·44 + 7·8 = 88 + 56 = 144.
--    - Since d 1 = 4, which is not divisible by 5, we have 5 ∤ d 1. Since d 3 = 44, which is also not divisible by 5, we have 5 ∤ d 3.
--    - If m ∈ [1, 3] (the two-element list), then m = 1 or m = 3. In the first case 5 ∤ d m follows from 5 ∤ d 1, and in the second case from 5 ∤ d 3. Thus, for all m ∈ [1, 3], 5 ∤ d m.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The sequence d is well-defined by the given base cases and recurrence, with d 3 = 44 and d 4 = 144. Moreover, 5 does not divide d 1 or d 3, and consequently for every m in the list [1, 3], 5 does not divide d m.
