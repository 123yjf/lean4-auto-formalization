-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We want to show that the equation tan(2x) = cos(x/2) has exactly five solutions in the interval [0, 2π]. In Lean, this is expressed as the existence of a finite set of real numbers with exactly five elements, all lying in [0, 2π], consisting precisely of the solutions to the equation in that interval.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Define F(x) = tan(2x) − cos(x/2). The tangent term has vertical asymptotes where cos(2x) = 0, namely at x = π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4. These points split [0, 2π] into five open subintervals. On each subinterval, F is continuous and strictly increasing, so it has at most one zero there. Near each asymptote, tan(2x) diverges to ±∞, so across each subinterval F traverses all real values, guaranteeing exactly one zero per subinterval. Using F(0) < 0 and F(2π) > 0 to control the ends, we conclude there are exactly five solutions in total.
-- 3. [Proof] Set F(x) = tan(2x) − cos(x/2). The points x ∈ {π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4} satisfy cos(2x) = 0, so tan(2x) has vertical asymptotes there. These split [0, 2π] into the five open intervals (0, π/4), (π/4, 3π/4), (3π/4, 5π/4), (5π/4, 7π/4), (7π/4, 2π). On each of these, tan(2x) is continuous (no poles) and differentiable, and so is cos(x/2), hence F is continuous. Moreover, by the given monotonicity fact, F is strictly increasing on each of these five intervals, so it can have at most one zero per interval. At the endpoints: F(0) = tan 0 − cos 0 = −1 < 0 and F(2π) = tan(4π) − cos π = 1 > 0, so F starts negative and ends positive. As x approaches any asymptote from the left or right, tan(2x) diverges to ±∞, so F takes arbitrarily large positive and negative values near the bounds of each subinterval. Thus, on each of the five subintervals, by the intermediate value theorem and strict monotonicity, there is exactly one x with F(x) = 0. Collecting these five distinct solutions into a finite set yields a set of cardinality 5 that contains exactly all solutions in [0, 2π]. In Lean, this entire counting statement is packaged in the lemma solution_count_is_five, and the final theorem simply invokes it.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The equation tan(2x) = cos(x/2) has exactly five solutions in [0, 2π]. Equivalently, there exists a finite set of five real numbers in [0, 2π] containing precisely all solutions to the equation on that interval.
