-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the number of perfect-square divisors of the product ∏_{k=1}^9 (k!), and confirm the prime factorization of this product. Conclude that this number equals 672 via the standard divisor-counting formula for squares based on prime exponents.
-- 2. [Key Idea] If N has prime factorization N = ∏ p_i^{e_i}, then the number of perfect-square divisors of N is ∏ (⌊e_i/2⌋ + 1). Thus, once we know the exponents e_i of each prime in ∏_{k=1}^9 (k!), we multiply these contributions over the primes.
-- 3. [Proof] The product ∏_{k=1}^9 (k!) (the superfactorial up to 9) has prime factorization 2^30 · 3^13 · 5^5 · 7^3. Therefore, the number of perfect-square divisors is:
   - for p = 2: 30/2 + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16,
   - for p = 3: 13/2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7,
   - for p = 5: 5/2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3,
   - for p = 7: 3/2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.
  Multiplying these gives 16 · 7 · 3 · 2 = 672. The Lean proof packages these facts as lemmas: it asserts the prime factorization, computes each term (e_i/2 + 1) by evaluation, multiplies them to 672, and then exhibits n = 672 as the required count, with the equalities verified.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The product ∏_{k=1}^9 (k!) factors as 2^30 · 3^13 · 5^5 · 7^3, and the number of its perfect-square divisors is 672.
