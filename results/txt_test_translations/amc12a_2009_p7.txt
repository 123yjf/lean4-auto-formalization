-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exist a real number x and a natural number n such that:
--    (i) (5x − 11) − (2x − 3) = (3x + 1) − (5x − 11),
--    (ii) the nth term of the arithmetic sequence with first term 2x − 3 and common difference (5x − 11) − (2x − 3) equals 2009, where arithmetic_seq a₁ d n := a₁ + (n − 1)·d,
--    and (iii) n = 502.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Explicitly choose x = 4 and n = 502, then compute:
--    - 2x − 3, 5x − 11, and 3x + 1 to verify the equal-difference condition,
--    - the first term a₁ and common difference d,
--    - the nth term a₁ + (n − 1)d to confirm it equals 2009.
-- 3. [Proof] Take x = 4 and n = 502.
--    - Compute the three linear expressions: 2x − 3 = 2·4 − 3 = 5, 5x − 11 = 5·4 − 11 = 9, and 3x + 1 = 3·4 + 1 = 13. Then
--      (5x − 11) − (2x − 3) = 9 − 5 = 4 and (3x + 1) − (5x − 11) = 13 − 9 = 4, so the required equality holds.
--    - The arithmetic sequence has first term a₁ = 2x − 3 = 5 and common difference d = (5x − 11) − (2x − 3) = 4. Its nth term is
--      a₁ + (n − 1)d = 5 + (502 − 1)·4 = 5 + 501·4 = 5 + 2004 = 2009, as required.
--    - Finally, n = 502 is immediate by our choice.
-- 4. [Conclusion] With x = 4 and n = 502, all three conditions are satisfied; hence such x and n exist.
