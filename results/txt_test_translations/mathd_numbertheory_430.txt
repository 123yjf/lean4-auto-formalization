-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exist natural numbers A, B, C between 1 and 9, all pairwise distinct, such that A + B = C, 11A − B = 2C, C·B = 11A + A, and A + B + C = 8.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Exhibit a specific triple (A, B, C) = (1, 3, 4) and use a given verification lemma that guarantees these values satisfy all the required conditions.
-- 3. [Proof] We choose A = 1, B = 3, and C = 4. The proof then invokes the axiom solution_verification specialized to (1, 3, 4), along with trivial equalities A = 1, B = 3, C = 4 (provided by reflexivity), to conclude that this triple satisfies each of the listed inequalities and equations. Therefore, the existential statement is established by this explicit witness.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Such numbers exist; for example, A = 1, B = 3, and C = 4 satisfy all the required conditions.
