-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exist natural numbers A, B, C, each less than 10, such that:
   - 3^17 + 3^10 equals the 9-digit decimal number whose digits are A B C A C C B A B (i.e., 100000000*A + 10000000*B + 1000000*C + 100000*A + 10000*C + 1000*C + 100*B + 10*A + B),
   - and the three-digit number ABC equals 129, i.e., 100*A + 10*B + C = 129.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Choose A = 1, B = 2, C = 9 (so that ABC = 129) and verify directly that 3^17 + 3^10 = 129199212, whose decimal expansion is exactly A B C A C C B A B with these choices.
-- 3. [Proof] Take A = 1, B = 2, C = 9. Trivially A, B, C are each less than 10. Compute 3^17 + 3^10 = 129199212. Its decimal expansion is 1·10^8 + 2·10^7 + 9·10^6 + 1·10^5 + 9·10^4 + 9·10^3 + 2·10^2 + 1·10 + 2, which matches the required pattern with A = 1, B = 2, C = 9. Also 100*A + 10*B + C = 129 holds by construction.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Such digits exist; specifically A = 1, B = 2, C = 9 satisfy all the required conditions.
