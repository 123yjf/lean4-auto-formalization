-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exists a real number overall_mean such that:
--    (a) There exists a positive real k for which, with morning_students = 3k, afternoon_students = 4k, morning_average = 84, afternoon_average = 70, the overall_mean equals the weighted average total_points / total_students, and
--    (b) overall_mean = 76.
--    In effect, we must prove that the combined average of two groups with sizes in the ratio 3:4 and averages 84 and 70 is 76.

-- 2. [Key Idea] Choose overall_mean = 76 and pick a specific positive k (namely k = 1). By the given axiom weighted_average_calculation, for any k > 0 the weighted average (84·3k + 70·4k)/(3k + 4k) equals 76. With k = 1, this shows the desired equality, and setting overall_mean = 76 satisfies both required conditions.

-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - Define overall_mean to be 76.
--    - To witness the inner existence, take k = 1, which is clearly positive.
--    - With k = 1, simplify the expressions (multiplying by 1 does nothing), so the weighted average becomes (84·(3·1) + 70·(4·1))/((3·1) + (4·1)).
--    - By the axiom weighted_average_calculation applied at k = 1, this ratio equals 76. Since we need overall_mean = (that ratio) and overall_mean was defined as 76, we flip the equality to get 76 = (that ratio), which matches the required direction.
--    - The second requirement, overall_mean = 76, is immediate by the definition of overall_mean.

-- 4. [Conclusion] There exists an overall mean that equals the combined (weighted) average for some positive k (indeed k = 1 suffices), and this overall mean is 76.
