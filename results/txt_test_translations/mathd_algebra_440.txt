-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove over the real numbers that (3/2) ÷ 3 × 10 = 5.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Simplify step by step: first compute (3/2) ÷ 3, then multiply the result by 10.
-- 3. [Proof] Compute (3/2) ÷ 3 = (3/2) × (1/3) = 3/(2×3) = 1/2. Next, compute (1/2) × 10 = 5. Substituting these two simplifications into the original expression yields 5.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, (3/2) ÷ 3 × 10 = 5.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove over the real numbers that (3/2) × (10/3) = 5.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use fraction multiplication and cancellation: (a/b) × (c/d) = (ac)/(bd).
-- 3. [Proof] Compute (3/2) × (10/3) = (3×10)/(2×3) = 30/6 = 5, equivalently cancel the common factor 3 to get 10/2 = 5.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, (3/2) × (10/3) = 5.
