-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Define f(x) = 1 / (x + 2) on rational numbers. Prove that f(f(1)) = 3/7.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Evaluate f at 1 to get 1/3, then evaluate f at 1/3 to get 3/7. This follows from straightforward rational arithmetic, and then substitute the first result into the second.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - First compute f(1): f(1) = 1 / (1 + 2) = 1 / 3.
--    - Next compute f(1/3): f(1/3) = 1 / ((1/3) + 2) = 1 / (1/3 + 6/3) = 1 / (7/3) = 3/7.
--    - Therefore f(f(1)) = f(1/3) = 3/7.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Since f(1) = 1/3 and f(1/3) = 3/7, it follows that f(f(1)) = 3/7.
