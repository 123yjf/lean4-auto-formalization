-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that the cube root of 16 times the cube root of 8 squared equals 4; that is, ((16) * ((8)^2)^(1/3))^(1/3) = 4 over the real numbers.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Simplify step by step: compute 8^2 = 64; take the real cube root of 64 as 4 (since 4^3 = 64 and for nonnegative bases, taking a power and then the reciprocal power returns the base); then compute 16 · 4 = 64, whose cube root is again 4.
-- 3. [Proof] 
   - First, 8^2 = 64.
   - Next, (64)^(1/3) = 4 because 4^3 = 64 and, for a ≥ 0 and p ≠ 0, (a^p)^(1/p) = a; here a = 4 ≥ 0 and p = 3 ≠ 0, so (4^3)^(1/3) = 4.
   - Therefore, (16 · 4)^(1/3) = 4 since 16 · 4 = 64 and the previous step shows 64^(1/3) = 4.
   - Chaining equalities: replace (8)^2 by 64, then (64)^(1/3) by 4, then 16 · 4 by 64, yielding the overall value 4.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The given expression simplifies to 4.
