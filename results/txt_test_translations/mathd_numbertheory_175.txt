-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that the remainder of 2^2010 upon division by 10 is 4; equivalently, determine the last decimal digit of 2^2010.
-- 2. [Key Idea] The powers of 2 modulo 10 are periodic with period 4: 2, 4, 8, 6, and then the pattern repeats. So 2^n mod 10 depends only on n mod 4. Since 2010 mod 4 = 2, 2^2010 mod 10 matches 2^2 mod 10.
-- 3. [Proof] Compute the first few residues modulo 10:
--    • 2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 10)
--    • 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 10)
--    • 2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 10)
--    • 2^4 ≡ 6 (mod 10)
--    • 2^5 ≡ 2 (mod 10), confirming the cycle repeats every 4 steps.
--    Next, compute 2010 mod 4 = 2. Therefore, 2^2010 mod 10 is the same as 2^2 mod 10, which is 4. (The Lean script also verifies this final value directly with a numeric tactic.)
-- 4. [Conclusion] The remainder of 2^2010 upon division by 10 is 4, i.e., (2^2010) % 10 = 4.
