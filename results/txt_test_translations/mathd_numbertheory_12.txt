-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Count how many integers n with 0 ≤ n ≤ 85 satisfy 15 ≤ n ≤ 85 and are divisible by 20. Equivalently, count the multiples of 20 between 15 and 85 inclusive.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Count all multiples of 20 below 86, subtract those below 15, and use set difference and cardinality to justify this subtraction.
-- 3. [Proof] The set (Finset.range 86) is {0, 1, ..., 85}. Among these, the multiples of 20 are 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, so there are 5 in total. Among (Finset.range 15) = {0, ..., 14}, the only multiple of 20 is 0, so there is 1. The set of interest, {n | n < 86, 15 ≤ n ≤ 85, and 20 ∣ n}, is exactly the set of multiples of 20 below 86 with those below 15 removed; formally, it is the set difference (range 86 filtered by 20 ∣ n) \ (range 15 filtered by 20 ∣ n). This equality is checked by elementwise reasoning: membership in the left implies membership in the left-hand filter and exclusion from the right-hand filter, and conversely exclusion from the right-hand filter enforces n ≥ 15, while n < 86 gives n ≤ 85. Since the smaller filtered set is a subset of the larger one, the cardinality of the difference equals the difference of cardinalities. Therefore, the desired count is 5 − 1 = 4.
-- 4. [Conclusion] There are exactly 4 multiples of 20 between 15 and 85 inclusive.
