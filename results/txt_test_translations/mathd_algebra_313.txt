-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We define V = 1 + i and Z = 2 − i in the complex numbers. The goal is to show V / Z = 1/5 + (3/5)i.
-- 2. [Key Idea] To divide complex numbers, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (here, 2 + i). This makes the denominator real. Then compute the products explicitly and simplify by separating real and imaginary parts.
-- 3. [Proof] 
- First, unfold the definitions V = 1 + i and Z = 2 − i, so the target is (1 + i) / (2 − i) = 1/5 + (3/5)i.
- Note that 2 + i ≠ 0, so we may multiply numerator and denominator by 2 + i:
  (1 + i) / (2 − i) = ((1 + i)(2 + i)) / ((2 − i)(2 + i)).
- Compute the numerator: (1 + i)(2 + i) = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = (2 − 1) + 3i = 1 + 3i, using i^2 = −1.
- Compute the denominator: (2 − i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i − 2i − i^2 = 4 + 1 = 5, again using i^2 = −1.
- Therefore, (1 + i) / (2 − i) = (1 + 3i) / 5. Writing this in standard a + bi form gives (1/5) + (3/5)i.
- Lean’s field_simp and ring_nf steps carry out these algebraic manipulations and simplifications, and the nonzero conditions for the conjugate are discharged by simple checks.
- A verification step confirms the result by multiplying back: ((1/5) + (3/5)i) · (2 − i) = 1 + i = V.
-- 4. [Conclusion] By multiplying by the conjugate and simplifying, we obtain V / Z = (1 + i) / (2 − i) = (1 + 3i) / 5 = 1/5 + (3/5)i.
