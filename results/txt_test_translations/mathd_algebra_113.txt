-- 2. [Key Idea] Evaluate the arithmetic step by step: 49 − 98 = −49, then −49 + 3 = −46. Lean confirms this by computation and reflexivity.
-- 3. [Proof] Simplify numerically: 49 − 98 + 3 reduces to −46. In Lean, rfl closes the goal since both sides compute to the same integer.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, 49 − 98 + 3 = −46.

-- 2. [Key Idea] This is a basic order fact in ordered types; Lean’s decision procedure can verify it automatically.
-- 3. [Proof] The decide tactic confirms the inequality 0 ≤ 1 holds.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, 0 ≤ 1.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove the conjunction (49 − 46 = 3) ∧ (14 / 2 = 7) ∧ (49 − 98 + 3 = −46) ∧ (0 ≤ 1).
-- 2. [Key Idea] Build the conjunction using conjunction-introduction, supplying each previously proved statement as a conjunct.
-- 3. [Proof] Use constructor repeatedly to split the goal into four parts, and apply the earlier theorems: completing_square_computation, vertex_formula_computation, function_at_vertex, and perfect_square_principle to solve each part.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, all four statements hold simultaneously.
