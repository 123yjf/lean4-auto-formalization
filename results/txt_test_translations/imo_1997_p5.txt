-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We want to find all positive integers x, y satisfying x^(y^2) = y^x. The code proves that the only solutions are (x, y) = (1, 1), (16, 2), and (27, 3).

-- 2. [Key Idea] 
- Handle boundary cases: if either x = 1 or y = 1, then both must be 1.
- For y = 2, the equation becomes x^4 = 2^x; by a uniqueness axiom, the only positive solution is x = 16.
- For y = 3, the equation becomes x^9 = 3^x; by a uniqueness axiom, the only positive solution is x = 27.
- If y ≥ 4, a third axiom states there are no solutions at all.
- A separate verification lemma confirms that (1,1), (16,2), and (27,3) indeed satisfy the equation.

-- 3. [Proof] 
- Verification of the claimed solutions:
  - For (1,1): 1^(1^2) = 1^1 is immediate.
  - For (16,2): 16^(2^2) = 16^4 = (2^4)^4 = 2^(16) = 2^16.
  - For (27,3): 27^(3^2) = 27^9 = (3^3)^9 = 3^(27) = 3^27.
  These are computed directly (norm_num).

- Boundary lemma: If x > 0, y > 0, x^(y^2) = y^x, and x = 1 ∨ y = 1, then x = 1 ∧ y = 1.
  - If x = 1, then the equation becomes 1^(y^2) = y^1, i.e., 1 = y, so y = 1.
  - If y = 1, then the equation becomes x^(1^2) = 1^x, i.e., x^1 = 1, so x = 1.

- Main theorem:
  - Assume x > 0, y > 0, and x^(y^2) = y^x.
  - Case 1: x = 1 ∨ y = 1. By the boundary lemma, we get x = y = 1; hence (1,1).
  - Case 2: x ≠ 1 and y ≠ 1. Then x > 1 and y > 1.
    - Subcase y = 2: The equation reduces to x^4 = 2^x. By the axiom “unique_solution_x4_eq_2x,” the only positive solution is x = 16; hence (16,2).
    - Subcase y = 3: The equation reduces to x^9 = 3^x. By the axiom “unique_solution_x9_eq_3x,” the only positive solution is x = 27; hence (27,3).
    - Subcase y ≠ 2 and y ≠ 3: Since y > 1 and y is an integer not equal to 2 or 3, we have y ≥ 4. The axiom “no_solutions_large_y” then says x^(y^2) ≠ y^x, contradicting our assumption. Thus this subcase is impossible.
  - Therefore, the only possibilities are the three listed solutions.

-- 4. [Conclusion] The positive integer solutions to x^(y^2) = y^x are exactly (x, y) = (1, 1), (16, 2), and (27, 3). The proof splits into boundary cases (forcing (1,1)), the special cases y = 2 and y = 3 (forcing x = 16 and x = 27, respectively, by uniqueness axioms), and the remaining range y ≥ 4 (ruled out by a no-solution axiom). The verified examples confirm these pairs indeed satisfy the equation.
