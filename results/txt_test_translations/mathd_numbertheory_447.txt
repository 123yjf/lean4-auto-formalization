-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We define the units digit of a natural number n to be n mod 10. Consider the multiples of 3 up to 50, namely the set {0, 3, 6, …, 48}, obtained as 3k for k = 0, 1, …, 16. Let sumUnitsDigits be the sum of the units digits of all these numbers. The goal is to show that this sum equals 78.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Compute the sum directly by enumerating the 17 multiples of 3 up to 48 and adding their units digits. (Auxiliary lemmas also record the repeating pattern of units digits of multiples of 3 modulo 10, whose complete cycle sums to 45, with the remaining 7 terms contributing 33, for a total of 78, but the main proof proceeds by direct computation.)
-- 3. [Proof] First, we identify the underlying set explicitly: by definition, the multiples of 3 up to 50 are exactly {0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48}. Then, expanding sumUnitsDigits as the sum over this set and unfolding the definition unitsDigit n = n % 10, a straightforward numeric calculation shows that the sum of these 17 units digits is 78. This direct computation is encapsulated in the lemma that the sum unitsDigit 0 + unitsDigit 3 + … + unitsDigit 48 equals 78.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 up to 50 is 78.
