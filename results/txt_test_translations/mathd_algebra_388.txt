-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We are given two linear equations in real variables x, y, z:
--    (1) 3x + 4y − 12z = 10 and (2) −2x − 3y + 9z = −4.
--    The goal is to show that any real triple (x, y, z) satisfying both equations must have x = 14.

-- 2. [Key Idea] Solve the system by linear elimination: scale the first equation by 3 and the second by 4 so that the y- and z-terms cancel when added, leaving a single equation in x. This yields x = 14. The Lean proof uses the linarith tactic to perform this linear combination automatically. Auxiliary lemmas explicitly justify each algebraic step: scaling each equation, cancellation of coefficients upon addition, the arithmetic on the right-hand side, and a direct check that the system is consistent by exhibiting y and z when x = 14.

-- 3. [Proof] Assume 3x + 4y − 12z = 10 and −2x − 3y + 9z = −4.
--    - Multiply the first equation by 3 to get 9x + 12y − 36z = 30 (lemma eq1_times_3).
--    - Multiply the second equation by 4 to get −8x − 12y + 36z = −16 (lemma eq2_times_4).
--    - Add these two resulting equations. On the left, the y- and z-terms cancel:
--      (9x + 12y − 36z) + (−8x − 12y + 36z) = x (lemma coefficient_cancellation).
--      On the right, 30 + (−16) = 14 (lemma rhs_arithmetic).
--      Therefore, x = 14 (lemma add_transformed_eqs).
--    - This elimination is exactly what linarith automates in the main theorem: after unfolding the definitions of the two equations, linarith derives x = 14 from the given linear equalities.
--    - To confirm the system is consistent (i.e., a solution exists with x = 14), we can take y = −8 and z = 0 and check directly that both equations hold (lemmas system_consistency and direct_verification).

-- 4. [Conclusion] Any real triple (x, y, z) satisfying the two given equations must have x = 14. The result follows by a standard elimination step (or automatically via linarith), and the system indeed admits solutions with this x (for example, y = −8 and z = 0).
