-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exist two real numbers x₁ and x₂ such that (x₁ + 3)^2 = 121 and (x₂ + 3)^2 = 121, with x₁ ≠ x₂, and whose sum is x₁ + x₂ = -6.

-- 2. [Key Idea] Provide explicit witnesses x₁ = 8 and x₂ = -14, then verify directly:
- (8 + 3)^2 = 121 and (-14 + 3)^2 = 121,
- 8 ≠ -14,
- 8 + (-14) = -6.
All checks are simple arithmetic.

-- 3. [Proof] Take x₁ = 8 and x₂ = -14.
- Compute (x₁ + 3)^2 = (8 + 3)^2 = 11^2 = 121.
- Compute (x₂ + 3)^2 = (-14 + 3)^2 = (-11)^2 = 121.
- They are distinct since 8 ≠ -14.
- Their sum is 8 + (-14) = -6.
Additionally, the auxiliary lemmas record the same verifications: one lemma states (8 + 3)^2 = 121 and (-14 + 3)^2 = 121, and another states 8 + (-14) = -6.

-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, the choices x₁ = 8 and x₂ = -14 satisfy all the required conditions, so the desired real numbers exist.
