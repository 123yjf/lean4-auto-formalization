-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We want to show that the finite product over k = 0, 1, ..., 6 of (2^(2^k) + 3^(2^k)) equals 3^128 − 2^128, working in the real numbers.

-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the classical telescoping factorization
   (x − y) ∏_{k=0}^{n} (x^(2^k) + y^(2^k)) = x^(2^(n+1)) − y^(2^(n+1)),
   proved by induction on n. Then apply it with x = 3, y = 2, and n = 6. Since 3 − 2 = 1, the prefactor disappears, and 2^7 = 128 gives the final exponent. Finally, note that 3^(2^k) + 2^(2^k) = 2^(2^k) + 3^(2^k), so the order inside each sum does not matter.

-- 3. [Proof]
   - Telescoping identity: For real x ≠ y and any natural number n,
     (x − y) ∏_{k=0}^{n} (x^(2^k) + y^(2^k)) = x^(2^(n+1)) − y^(2^(n+1)).
     This is proved by induction on n.
     • Base case n = 0: The product over k = 0 is just x^(2^0) + y^(2^0) = x + y, so
       (x − y)(x + y) = x^2 − y^2, as desired.
     • Inductive step: Assume the identity for n. Multiply both sides by x^(2^(n+1)) + y^(2^(n+1)).
       On the left, this appends the next factor to the product. On the right, use
       (A − B)(A + B) = A^2 − B^2 with A = x^(2^n) and B = y^(2^n) to obtain
       x^(2·2^n) − y^(2·2^n) = x^(2^(n+1)) − y^(2^(n+1)). This gives the step.
   - Apply the identity with x = 3, y = 2, and n = 6 (so the product runs over k = 0 to 6):
     (3 − 2) ∏_{k=0}^{6} (3^(2^k) + 2^(2^k)) = 3^(2^7) − 2^(2^7).
   - Simplify both sides:
     • Since 3 − 2 = 1, the left side becomes just ∏_{k=0}^{6} (3^(2^k) + 2^(2^k)).
     • Since 2^7 = 128, the right side is 3^128 − 2^128.
   - Finally, the product we need has the summands in the opposite order, but addition is commutative:
     for each k, 3^(2^k) + 2^(2^k) = 2^(2^k) + 3^(2^k), so the two products are equal.

-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, ∏_{k=0}^{6} (2^(2^k) + 3^(2^k)) = 3^128 − 2^128.
