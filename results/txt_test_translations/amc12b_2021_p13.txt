-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We want to show there exists a finite set S of real angles with exactly 6 elements such that:
--    - every θ in S lies in the interval [0, 2π],
--    - each such θ satisfies the trigonometric equation 1 − 3 sin θ + 5 cos(3θ) = 0,
--    - and conversely, every θ in [0, 2π] that satisfies this equation is contained in S.
--    In other words, the equation has exactly six solutions in [0, 2π], and S is precisely the set of all those solutions.
-- 2. [Key Idea] The code first establishes the triple-angle identity cos(3θ) = cos θ · (1 − 4 sin² θ). This allows the equation 1 − 3 sin θ + 5 cos(3θ) = 0 to be rewritten as an equivalent form involving only sin θ and cos θ without higher angles: 1 − 3 sin θ + 5 cos θ · (1 − 4 sin² θ) = 0. However, the actual counting and existence of exactly six solutions in [0, 2π] is taken from a provided axiom; the proof does not derive this count from scratch.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - First, the lemma cos_triple_sine is proved. Starting from the standard identity cos(3θ) = 4 cos³ θ − 3 cos θ, factor out cos θ to get cos θ · (4 cos² θ − 3). Then use cos² θ = 1 − sin² θ to rewrite 4 cos² θ − 3 as 4(1 − sin² θ) − 3 = 1 − 4 sin² θ. This yields cos(3θ) = cos θ · (1 − 4 sin² θ).
--    - Next, the lemma equation_transform states that for every θ, the original equation 1 − 3 sin θ + 5 cos(3θ) = 0 is equivalent to 1 − 3 sin θ + 5 cos θ · (1 − 4 sin² θ) = 0. This is a direct substitution of the triple-angle identity followed by associativity of multiplication.
--    - For the main theorem, after recording this equivalence, the proof does not use it further. Instead, it directly invokes the axiom amc12b_2021_p13_solution_count, which asserts the existence of a finite set S with exactly six elements, all lying in [0, 2π], that contains precisely the solutions to 1 − 3 sin θ + 5 cos(3θ) = 0 in that interval. This axiom immediately yields the desired conclusion.
-- 4. [Conclusion] By establishing the triple-angle identity and the resulting equivalence of the equation, and then appealing to the provided existence-and-completeness result, we conclude that there is a finite set S of size 6 consisting exactly of the solutions θ ∈ [0, 2π] to 1 − 3 sin θ + 5 cos(3θ) = 0.
