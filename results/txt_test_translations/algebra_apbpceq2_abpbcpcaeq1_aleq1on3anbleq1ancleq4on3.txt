-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] From the constraint ab + bc + ca = 1, show that a(b + c) + bc = 1. (The sum constraint a + b + c = 2 is not used here.)
-- 2. [Key Idea] Rewrite a(b + c) + bc as ab + ac + bc, which is exactly the given product constraint.
-- 3. [Proof] Expand a(b + c) + bc to ab + ac + bc and use the hypothesis ab + bc + ca = 1. A ring-normalization step confirms the expressions match.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, a(b + c) + bc = 1.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given a + b + c = 2 and ab + bc + ca = 1, show that bc = 1 − 2a + a^2.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Substitute b + c = 2 − a into the identity a(b + c) + bc = 1 and solve for bc.
-- 3. [Proof] From the first result, b + c = 2 − a. From the second result, a(b + c) + bc = 1. Substituting gives a(2 − a) + bc = 1, i.e., 2a − a^2 + bc = 1, hence bc = 1 − 2a + a^2. Ring normalization and linear arithmetic justify the rearrangement.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, bc = 1 − 2a + a^2.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Under the same constraints, show that bc = (1 − a)^2.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Recognize 1 − 2a + a^2 as (1 − a)^2.
-- 3. [Proof] From the previous theorem, bc = 1 − 2a + a^2. This is the binomial square (1 − a)^2. A ring-normalization step verifies the identity.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, bc = (1 − a)^2.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Assume a + b + c = 2 and a ≤ b ≤ c. Show that a ≤ 2/3 and c ≥ 2/3. (The product constraint is not used.)
-- 2. [Key Idea] Prove each bound by contradiction using the ordering a ≤ b ≤ c and the identity b + c = 2 − a (or a + b = 2 − c).
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - For a ≤ 2/3: Suppose a > 2/3. Then from b + c = 2 − a we get b + c < 4/3. But since b ≥ a and c ≥ b ≥ a, we have b + c ≥ 2a, so 2a < 4/3, i.e., a < 2/3, a contradiction.
--    - For c ≥ 2/3: Suppose c < 2/3. Then from a + b = 2 − c we get a + b > 4/3. But a ≤ b ≤ c implies a + b ≤ 2c, so 2c > 4/3, i.e., c > 2/3, a contradiction.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, a ≤ 2/3 and c ≥ 2/3.
