-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exists exactly one natural number n such that gcd(n, 40) = 10 and lcm(n, 40) = 280.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the identity a · b = gcd(a, b) · lcm(a, b). Applied to (n, 40), this gives n · 40 = 10 · 280 = 2800. Cancelling the factor 40 yields n = 70. Verify that n = 70 indeed has gcd 10 and lcm 280. Uniqueness follows from the cancellation.
-- 3. [Proof] 
- First, recall the general fact: for all natural numbers a and b, a · b = gcd(a, b) · lcm(a, b).
- Suppose gcd(n, 40) = 10 and lcm(n, 40) = 280. Substituting into the identity gives n · 40 = 10 · 280.
- Compute 10 · 280 = 2800. Hence n · 40 = 2800.
- Cancelling 40 (which is positive) from both sides gives n = 2800 / 40 = 70.
- Check that n = 70 satisfies the conditions: gcd(70, 40) = 10 and lcm(70, 40) = 280 (these follow by straightforward computation; one can also note the factorizations 40 = 2^3 · 5 and 70 = 2 · 5 · 7).
- For uniqueness, if any n satisfies the conditions, then from n · 40 = 2800 and 70 · 40 = 2800, cancellation of the positive factor 40 yields n = 70.
-- 4. [Conclusion] There exists a unique natural number n with gcd(n, 40) = 10 and lcm(n, 40) = 280, namely n = 70.
