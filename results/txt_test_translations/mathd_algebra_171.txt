-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that f(1) = 9, where f(x) = 5x + 4 for real x.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Evaluate the linear function at x = 1: compute 5 · 1 + 4.
-- 3. [Proof] By definition, f(1) = 5 · 1 + 4. Since 5 · 1 = 5 and 5 + 4 = 9, it follows that f(1) = 9. In Lean, this is achieved by unfolding the definition of f and letting arithmetic normalization verify the computation.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, f 1 = 9.
