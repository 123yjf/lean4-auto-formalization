-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For real x with 3 − x ≥ 0 and x + 1 ≥ 0, show that Real.sqrt (3 − x) ≥ Real.sqrt (x + 1) if and only if x ≤ 1.
-- 2. [Key Idea] The square root function is monotone on nonnegative numbers. Under the nonnegativity of both radicands, comparing the square roots is equivalent to comparing the insides.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - (→) Assume Real.sqrt (3 − x) ≥ Real.sqrt (x + 1). Since 0 ≤ 3 − x and 0 ≤ x + 1, we can remove the square roots to get x + 1 ≤ 3 − x. Rearranging yields x ≤ 1.
--    - (←) Assume x ≤ 1. Then x + 1 ≤ 3 − x. Applying monotonicity of the square root on nonnegatives gives Real.sqrt (x + 1) ≤ Real.sqrt (3 − x), i.e., Real.sqrt (3 − x) ≥ Real.sqrt (x + 1).
-- 4. [Conclusion] Under 3 − x ≥ 0 and x + 1 ≥ 0, the inequality between the square roots is equivalent to x ≤ 1.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] If Real.sqrt (Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1)) > 1/2, then 3 − x ≥ 0 and x + 1 ≥ 0.
-- 2. [Key Idea] If 3 − x < 0, then Real.sqrt (3 − x) = 0 and the inner expression is ≤ 0, forcing the outer square root to be 0, contradicting the strict positivity. A similar contradiction is attempted if x + 1 < 0.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - First conjunct: Suppose 3 − x < 0. Then Real.sqrt (3 − x) = 0. Hence Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) ≤ 0, so its square root is 0. This contradicts Real.sqrt (Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1)) > 1/2. Therefore 3 − x ≥ 0.
--    - Second conjunct: The proof proceeds by contradiction assuming x + 1 < 0, notes that Real.sqrt (x + 1) = 0, and begins to derive a contradiction; however, the argument is left unfinished in the code (marked “sorry”).
-- 4. [Conclusion] The code fully establishes 3 − x ≥ 0; the proof of x + 1 ≥ 0 is intended but left incomplete.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that (3 − x ≥ 0 ∧ x + 1 ≥ 0 ∧ Real.sqrt (3 − x) ≥ Real.sqrt (x + 1)) is equivalent to x ∈ [-1, 1].
-- 2. [Key Idea] Under nonnegativity, comparing square roots reduces to comparing the radicands; the bounds −1 ≤ x and x ≤ 1 come respectively from x + 1 ≥ 0 and from 3 − x ≥ x + 1.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - (→) From x + 1 ≥ 0 we get −1 ≤ x. From Real.sqrt (3 − x) ≥ Real.sqrt (x + 1) and the nonnegativity of both radicands, we deduce 3 − x ≥ x + 1, hence x ≤ 1. Thus x ∈ [-1, 1].
--    - (←) If x ∈ [-1, 1], then x + 1 ≥ 0 and 3 − x ≥ 0. Also x + 1 ≤ 3 − x, so Real.sqrt (x + 1) ≤ Real.sqrt (3 − x). Hence all three conditions hold.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The three domain/ordering conditions are equivalent to x ∈ [-1, 1].

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For x ∈ [-1, 1], prove that Real.sqrt (Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1)) > 1/2 if and only if Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) > 1/4.
-- 2. [Key Idea] On [-1, 1], we have Real.sqrt (3 − x) ≥ Real.sqrt (x + 1), so the inner expression is nonnegative. For a nonnegative quantity t, sqrt(t) > 1/2 is equivalent to t > (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
-- 3. [Proof] From x ∈ [-1, 1], we get x + 1 ≤ 3 − x, hence Real.sqrt (x + 1) ≤ Real.sqrt (3 − x), so Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) ≥ 0. 
--    - (→) If sqrt(inner) > 1/2, then by squaring (justified since both sides are nonnegative) we obtain inner > 1/4.
--    - (←) Conversely, if inner > 1/4, then taking square roots yields sqrt(inner) > 1/2.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The inequality with the outer square root is equivalent to the threshold inequality inner > 1/4 on the domain [-1, 1].

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] There exists x₀ = 1 − Real.sqrt 127 / 32 such that Real.sqrt (3 − x₀) − Real.sqrt (x₀ + 1) = 1/4.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Pick x₀ so that 3 − x₀ and x₀ + 1 become 2 ± (Real.sqrt 127)/32, and verify algebraically that the difference of the square roots is 1/4.
-- 3. [Proof] Define x₀ := 1 − Real.sqrt 127 / 32. One checks x₀ ∈ [-1, 1] using the bounds 0 ≤ Real.sqrt 127 < 32. Then 3 − x₀ = 2 + Real.sqrt 127 / 32 and x₀ + 1 = 2 − Real.sqrt 127 / 32. The remaining step is a direct calculation that Real.sqrt (2 + a) − Real.sqrt (2 − a) = 1/4 for a = Real.sqrt 127 / 32; this computational verification is left as a gap in the code (marked “sorry”).
-- 4. [Conclusion] The intended boundary point is exhibited and reduced to a concrete algebraic check; the final equality is asserted but not filled in the current code.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For x, y ∈ [-1, 1] with x < y, show Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) > Real.sqrt (3 − y) − Real.sqrt (y + 1).
-- 2. [Key Idea] The function t ↦ Real.sqrt (3 − t) is strictly decreasing and t ↦ Real.sqrt (t + 1) is strictly increasing on [-1, 1]; subtracting an increasing function from a decreasing one yields a strictly decreasing function.
-- 3. [Proof] From x < y we get 3 − y < 3 − x and x + 1 < y + 1. Since square root is strictly increasing on nonnegatives, Real.sqrt (3 − y) < Real.sqrt (3 − x) and Real.sqrt (x + 1) < Real.sqrt (y + 1). Combining these gives (larger) − (smaller) > (smaller) − (larger). The code establishes the preliminary inequalities and then leaves the final comparison step as a gap (marked “sorry”).
-- 4. [Conclusion] The function x ↦ Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) is strictly decreasing on [-1, 1], though the proof is left unfinished in the code.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Characterize the set {x ∈ ℝ | x ∈ [-1, 1] and Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) > 1/4} as the half-interval [-1, 1 − Real.sqrt 127 / 32).
-- 2. [Key Idea] There is a unique boundary point x₀ with Real.sqrt (3 − x₀) − Real.sqrt (x₀ + 1) = 1/4, and the function is strictly decreasing on [-1, 1]. Therefore the solution set is exactly those x in [-1, 1) less than x₀.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - (→) Given x ∈ [-1, 1] and the inequality > 1/4, use the boundary point x₀ with equality 1/4. If x ≥ x₀, monotonicity would force Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) ≤ 1/4, contradicting the strict inequality. Hence x < x₀, i.e., x ∈ [-1, x₀).
--    - (←) If x ∈ [-1, x₀), then x ∈ [-1, 1] and, by strict monotonicity, Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) > Real.sqrt (3 − x₀) − Real.sqrt (x₀ + 1) = 1/4.
--    Parts of this argument depend on the established boundary point and the monotonicity lemma; the code leaves some steps as “sorry”.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The set is exactly [-1, 1 − Real.sqrt 127 / 32), modulo the earlier lemmas and computations.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that {x ∈ ℝ | Real.sqrt (Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1)) > 1/2} = Set.Ico (−1) (1 − Real.sqrt 127 / 32).
-- 2. [Key Idea] 
--    - First, reduce the inequality with the outer square root to Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) > 1/4 by squaring, which requires x ∈ [-1, 1].
--    - Second, identify the domain [-1, 1] from the given inequality by noting the inner difference must be positive; then use an equivalence between (domain + inner sqrt inequality) and x ∈ [-1, 1].
--    - Third, use strict monotonicity of x ↦ Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) and the boundary point x₀ with equality 1/4 to conclude x < x₀.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - (⊆) Assume Real.sqrt (Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1)) > 1/2. Then the inner difference is strictly positive (otherwise the outer square root would be zero), so Real.sqrt (3 − x) ≥ Real.sqrt (x + 1). Using an auxiliary domain lemma, the code infers x ∈ [-1, 1]. With this, the squaring equivalence yields Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) > 1/4. Comparing with the boundary point x₀ where the difference equals 1/4 and invoking monotonicity shows x < x₀. Hence x ∈ Ico (−1, x₀).
--    - (⊇) If x ∈ Ico (−1, x₀), then x ∈ [-1, 1]. By monotonicity, Real.sqrt (3 − x) − Real.sqrt (x + 1) > Real.sqrt (3 − x₀) − Real.sqrt (x₀ + 1) = 1/4. Applying the squaring equivalence gives the desired inequality with the outer square root.
--    The code implements this plan, relying on earlier lemmas; several auxiliary steps (domain extraction, monotonicity, and the boundary calculation) are referenced with previously stated results, some of which are left partially incomplete in the code.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The solution set is the half-interval Ico (−1, 1 − Real.sqrt 127 / 32), in line with the classical result; the formal proof follows the standard reduction, boundary-point identification, and monotonicity argument, with some details deferred in the provided code.
