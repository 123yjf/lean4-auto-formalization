-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given real numbers a and b with a^2 + b^2 = 1, prove that |a| ≤ 1 and |b| ≤ 1.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Since squares are nonnegative, each square is bounded above by the sum a^2 + b^2 = 1. Then use the equivalence a^2 ≤ 1 ↔ |a| ≤ 1.
-- 3. [Proof] Because b^2 ≥ 0, we have a^2 ≤ a^2 + b^2 = 1, hence |a| ≤ 1. Similarly, since a^2 ≥ 0, we have b^2 ≤ a^2 + b^2 = 1, hence |b| ≤ 1.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Both |a| and |b| are at most 1.

-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For real numbers a and b with a^2 + b^2 = 1, show (a − b)^2 = 1 − 2ab.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Expand the square (a − b)^2 and substitute the given relation a^2 + b^2 = 1.
-- 3. [Proof] Expanding gives (a − b)^2 = a^2 − 2ab + b^2 = (a^2 + b^2) − 2ab. Using a^2 + b^2 = 1, we get (a − b)^2 = 1 − 2ab.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The identity (a − b)^2 = 1 − 2ab holds.

-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given real numbers a and b with a^2 + b^2 = 1, prove the lower bound ab ≥ −1/2.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the nonnegativity of (a + b)^2 to obtain 1 + 2ab ≥ 0, then divide by 2 (> 0).
-- 3. [Proof] Since (a + b)^2 ≥ 0, expanding yields a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ≥ 0. Substituting a^2 + b^2 = 1 gives 1 + 2ab ≥ 0, hence 2ab ≥ −1. Dividing both sides by 2 (a positive number) yields ab ≥ −1/2.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The product ab satisfies ab ≥ −1/2.
