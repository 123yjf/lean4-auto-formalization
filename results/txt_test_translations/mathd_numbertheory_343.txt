-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that (1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11) % 10 = 5; equivalently, the product 1·3·5·7·9·11 leaves remainder 5 upon division by 10.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Work modulo 10 by replacing each factor with its residue mod 10 and simplifying. Notably, 11 ≡ 1 (mod 10), and 3·7 ≡ 21 ≡ 1 (mod 10). A factor of 5 forces the final residue to be 5 after multiplying by residues that are 1 or 9.
-- 3. [Proof] In modulo 10 arithmetic: 11 ≡ 1 and 3·7 ≡ 21 ≡ 1, so
1·3·5·7·9·11 ≡ 1·1·5·9·1 ≡ 5·9 ≡ 45 ≡ 5 (mod 10).
Equivalently, the full product is 10395, whose last digit is 5, so the remainder upon division by 10 is 5. In Lean, the tactic norm_num performs this direct computation and modular reduction automatically, yielding the result.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, (1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11) % 10 = 5.
