-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exists a natural number n equal to 19 and a finite list of integers of length n whose elements are exactly the integers x satisfying |x| < 3π. Equivalently, count the integers with absolute value less than 3π and produce a list containing precisely those integers.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Since 3π lies strictly between 9 and 10, the condition |x| < 3π for an integer x is equivalent to -9 ≤ x ≤ 9. There are exactly 19 such integers. The proof relies on an existence package (count_result) that already provides n = 19, the equivalence |x| < 3π ↔ -9 ≤ x ≤ 9, and a corresponding list of all such integers with the correct length.
-- 3. [Proof] From count_result, obtain a natural number n with n = 19, the pointwise equivalence for all integers x that |x| < 3π ↔ -9 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 9, and a list integers whose length is n and whose membership is exactly the condition -9 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 9. Use this n and this list to witness the required existential statements. The length condition is already given. For the membership characterization, rewrite the given membership condition using the provided equivalence to obtain that, for every integer x, x is in the list if and only if |x| < 3π.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, there exists n = 19 and a list of integers of length 19 that contains exactly the integers with |x| < 3π. Hence the number of such integers is 19.
