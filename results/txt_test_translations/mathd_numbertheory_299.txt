-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that the units digit (i.e., the remainder modulo 10) of the product 1 · 3 · 5 · 7 · 9 · 11 · 13 is 5. More generally, prove that for any odd natural number n (that is, n % 2 = 1), one has (5 · n) % 10 = 5. Provide simple intermediate computations that reflect the step-by-step multiplication mod 10.

-- 2. [Key Idea] An odd number can be written as n = 2k + 1. Then 5n = 5(2k + 1) = 10k + 5, which leaves remainder 5 upon division by 10. Using this, once a running product is congruent to 5 modulo 10, multiplying by any further odd factor keeps it congruent to 5 modulo 10. The initial factors 1 and 3 give 3 mod 10; multiplying by 5 brings the residue to 5, and all subsequent multiplications by odd numbers keep it at 5.

-- 3. [Proof]
- General lemma (five_times_odd_mod_ten): Suppose n is odd, i.e., n % 2 = 1. By Euclidean division, n = 2 · (n / 2) + (n % 2). Using n % 2 = 1, we get n = 2k + 1 with k = n / 2. Then
  5n = 5(2k + 1) = 10k + 5,
  so modulo 10 this is congruent to 5. Formally, this is justified by rewriting n as 2k + 1, expanding, and using that addition and multiplication respect congruences mod 10.
- Intermediate computations:
  • (1 · 3) % 10 = 3 (direct calculation).
  • (3 · 5) % 10 = 5 (direct calculation).
  • For each odd m ∈ {7, 9, 11, 13}, (5 · m) % 10 = 5 by the lemma above.
- Putting it together for the full product 1 · 3 · 5 · 7 · 9 · 11 · 13:
  Start with (1 · 3) % 10 = 3. Multiply by 5 to get (3 · 5) % 10 = 5. Each subsequent multiplication by an odd factor (7, then 9, then 11, then 13) preserves the remainder 5 modulo 10 by the lemma, so the final product still has remainder 5 modulo 10.

-- 4. [Conclusion] The product 1 · 3 · 5 · 7 · 9 · 11 · 13 leaves remainder 5 upon division by 10; equivalently, its units digit is 5. More generally, 5 times any odd natural number always has units digit 5.
