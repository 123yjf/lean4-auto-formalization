-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show there exists a unique pair p = (a, b) of real numbers such that 3a + 2b = 5, a + b = 2, and moreover p = (1, 1).
-- 2. [Key Idea] Exhibit (1, 1) as a solution and then prove any solution must equal (1, 1) by solving the linear system: subtract the equations to get a = 1, then back-substitute to get b = 1.
-- 3. [Proof] For existence, take p = (1, 1) and check directly: 3·1 + 2·1 = 5 and 1 + 1 = 2, and of course p = (1, 1). For uniqueness, suppose p = (a, b) also satisfies the two equations. Subtract a + b = 2 from 3a + 2b = 5 to get a = 1; substituting back into a + b = 2 gives b = 1. Hence p = (a, b) = (1, 1).
-- 4. [Conclusion] There is exactly one pair satisfying the conditions, namely p = (1, 1).
