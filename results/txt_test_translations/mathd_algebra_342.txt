-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that there exist rational numbers a and d such that (5/2) · (2a + 4d) = 70 and (10/2) · (2a + 9d) = 210, and moreover a = 42/5.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Exhibit explicit values for a and d and verify both equations by straightforward arithmetic; then note the chosen a is indeed 42/5.
-- 3. [Proof] Choose a = 42/5 and d = 14/5.
--    - First equation: 2a + 4d = 2·(42/5) + 4·(14/5) = 84/5 + 56/5 = 140/5 = 28. Then (5/2)·(2a + 4d) = (5/2)·28 = 140/2 = 70.
--    - Second equation: 2a + 9d = 2·(42/5) + 9·(14/5) = 84/5 + 126/5 = 210/5 = 42. Since 10/2 = 5, we get (10/2)·(2a + 9d) = 5·42 = 210.
--    - Finally, by construction a = 42/5.
-- 4. [Conclusion] With a = 42/5 and d = 14/5, both required equations hold, and a equals 42/5, establishing the existence claim.
