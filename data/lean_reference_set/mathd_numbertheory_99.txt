-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the residue n (with 0 ≤ n ≤ 46) such that 2n ≡ 15 (mod 47).
-- 2. [Key Idea] Since 2 is invertible modulo 47, multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 (which is 24) to isolate n.
-- 3. [Proof] 
-- • Compute the inverse of 2 modulo 47: 2·24 = 48 ≡ 1 (mod 47), so 2⁻¹ ≡ 24 (mod 47).
-- • Multiply the congruence by 24: 24·2n ≡ 24·15 (mod 47), hence n ≡ 360 (mod 47).
-- • Reduce 360 modulo 47: 360 − 7·47 = 360 − 329 = 31, so n ≡ 31 (mod 47).
-- 4. [Conclusion] The unique residue between 0 and 46 satisfying 2n ≡ 15 (mod 47) is 31.
