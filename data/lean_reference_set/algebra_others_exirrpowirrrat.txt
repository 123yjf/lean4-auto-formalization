-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find irrational real numbers a and b such that the power aᵇ is rational.

-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the number √2. Consider c = (√2)^(√2). If c is rational, we can take a = √2 and b = √2. If c is irrational, then raising c to the power √2 gives (√2)^(√2·√2) = (√2)² = 2, a rational number; so take a = c and b = √2. Alternatively, use the fact that e and ln 2 are irrational and satisfy e^{ln 2} = 2.

-- 3. [Proof] 
Style A – Classical case split:
- Let b = √2, which is known to be irrational, and set c = (√2)^(√2).
- Case 1: If c is rational, take a = √2. Then a and b are both irrational, and aᵇ = c is rational.
- Case 2: If c is irrational, take a = c and keep b = √2. Using laws of exponents,
  aᵇ = ( (√2)^(√2) )^(√2) = (√2)^(√2·√2) = (√2)² = 2,
  which is rational.
In either case, we obtain irrational a, b with aᵇ rational.

Style B – One-shot choice:
- It is known that e is irrational and ln 2 is irrational. Set a = e and b = ln 2. Then
  aᵇ = e^{ln 2} = 2,
  which is rational.

-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, there exist irrational numbers a and b—indeed, explicitly obtainable choices—such that aᵇ is rational (for example, either a = √2, b = √2 if (√2)^(√2) is rational, or a = (√2)^(√2), b = √2 otherwise; or simply a = e, b = ln 2).
