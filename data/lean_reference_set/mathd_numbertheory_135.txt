-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the digits A, B, C in the 9-digit decimal expansion ABCACCBAB of n = 3^17 + 3^10, and show that 100A + 10B + C = 129.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use quick modular checks to pin down the digits: (i) the last digit of n fixes B via n mod 10, (ii) n is a multiple of 9 so the digit sum condition forces A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3), (iii) n ≡ −1 (mod 11), and the 11-divisibility alternating-sum rule for a 9-digit number reduces to B − A + C, giving B − A + C ≡ −1 (mod 11). Together with simple parity constraints, these congruences determine A, B, C uniquely.
-- 3. [Proof] Direct computation (as a quick check): 3^17 = 129140163, 3^10 = 59049, so n = 129140163 + 59049 = 129199212, whose digits are 1 2 9 1 9 9 2 1 2, i.e., ABCACCBAB. Thus (A, B, C) = (1, 2, 9), yielding 100A + 10B + C = 129.
Elegant modular derivation:
(a) Units digit. Since 3^4 ≡ 1 (mod 10), we have 3^17 ≡ 3 and 3^10 ≡ 9 (mod 10), so n ≡ 3 + 9 ≡ 2 (mod 10). Hence the last digit is B = 2.
(b) Divisibility by 9. For k ≥ 2, 3^k is divisible by 9, so n ≡ 0 (mod 9). The digit sum of ABCACCBAB is 3(A + B + C), thus 3(A + B + C) ≡ 0 (mod 9), i.e., A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3). Equivalently, A + C ≡ 1 (mod 3) since B = 2.
(c) Divisibility by 11. Modulo 11, 3 has period 5, so 3^17 + 3^10 ≡ 3^2 + 3^0 ≡ 9 + 1 ≡ −1 (mod 11). For a 9-digit number d9…d1, the alternating sum S = d1 − d2 + d3 − … + d9 is 0 mod 11 exactly when the number is 0 mod 11. For ABCACCBAB, this alternating sum simplifies to B − A + C. Since n ≡ −1 (mod 11), we get B − A + C ≡ −1 (mod 11). With B = 2 this is C − A ≡ 8 (mod 11).
(d) Narrowing the possibilities. Using simple parity (from n ≡ 0 mod 4, the last two digits 10A + B must be divisible by 4; with B = 2 this forces A odd), we restrict to A, C ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B = 2. Now impose the two congruences:
- A + C ≡ 1 (mod 3),
- C − A ≡ 8 (mod 11).
Check A ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}:
• A = 1 ⇒ C ≡ 9 (mod 11) gives C = 9; also 1 + 9 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Works.
• A = 3 ⇒ C ≡ 0 (mod 11), which is disallowed under the odd-digit restriction.
• A = 5 ⇒ C ≡ 2 (mod 11), even, so excluded by the parity restriction.
• A = 7 ⇒ C ≡ 4 (mod 11), even, excluded.
• A = 9 ⇒ C ≡ 6 (mod 11), even, excluded.
Thus the only admissible triple is (A, B, C) = (1, 2, 9).
(e) Required value. 100A + 10B + C = 100·1 + 10·2 + 9 = 129.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The digits are uniquely determined as A = 1, B = 2, C = 9, and therefore 100A + 10B + C = 129.
