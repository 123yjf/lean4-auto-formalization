-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that for every real number a, the quadratic expression a(2 − a) is at most 1.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Rewrite 1 − a(2 − a) as a perfect square. Since any square is nonnegative, it follows that a(2 − a) ≤ 1.
-- 3. [Proof] Algebraic proof: 1 − a(2 − a) = 1 − 2a + a² = (a − 1)² ≥ 0, hence a(2 − a) ≤ 1. Alternative proof (calculus): Let f(a) = a(2 − a) = −a² + 2a. Then f′(a) = −2a + 2, which vanishes at a = 1. Also, f″(a) = −2 < 0, so a = 1 is the global maximum, and f(1) = 1. Therefore f(a) ≤ 1 for all real a.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Because 1 − a(2 − a) = (a − 1)² ≥ 0, the inequality a(2 − a) ≤ 1 holds for all real a (with equality at a = 1).
