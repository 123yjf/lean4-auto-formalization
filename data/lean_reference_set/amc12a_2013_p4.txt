-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Compute the value of (2^{2014} + 2^{2012}) / (2^{2014} - 2^{2012}).
-- 2. [Key Idea] Factor out the common power 2^{2012} from both the numerator and denominator to reduce the expression to a ratio of small integers.
-- 3. [Proof] We rewrite the expression as [2^{2012}(2^2 + 1)] / [2^{2012}(2^2 - 1)] by factoring out 2^{2012}. The factor 2^{2012} cancels, leaving (4 + 1)/(4 - 1) = 5/3.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The expression equals 5/3.
