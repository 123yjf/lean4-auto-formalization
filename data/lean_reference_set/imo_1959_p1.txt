-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that for every natural number n, gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = 1; equivalently, 21n + 4 and 14n + 3 have no common divisor greater than 1.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Any common divisor of two integers divides all their integer linear combinations. If we can produce 1 as such a combination, then the greatest common divisor must be 1.
-- 3. [Proof] Let d = gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3). Consider the linear combination 3(14n + 3) − 2(21n + 4) = 42n + 9 − (42n + 8) = 1. Since d divides both 21n + 4 and 14n + 3, it divides any integer linear combination of them, in particular 1. Hence d = 1. Alternatively, by the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = gcd(14n + 3, (21n + 4) − (14n + 3)) = gcd(14n + 3, 7n + 1) = gcd(7n + 1, (14n + 3) − 2(7n + 1)) = gcd(7n + 1, 1) = 1.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = 1 for all n ∈ ℕ, so the fraction (21n + 4)/(14n + 3) is always in lowest terms.
