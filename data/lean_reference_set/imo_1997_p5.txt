-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement]
-- Show that the only positive integer pairs (x, y) satisfying x^(y^2) = y^x are (1, 1), (16, 2), and (27, 3).
-- 
-- 2. [Key Idea]
-- For x > 1 and y > 1, x and y must have exactly the same prime divisors. Comparing prime exponents forces the ratios of corresponding exponents to be equal, so x = y^c for some positive rational c. Substituting back yields c = y^(c − 2). Writing c in lowest terms as p/q then forces y to be a perfect q-th power, say y = z^q, and the equation becomes p/q = z^(p − 2q). A case split on the sign of p − 2q gives precisely the listed solutions.
-- 
-- 3. [Proof]
-- - Trivial cases:
--   - (1, 1) works: 1^(1^2) = 1^1 = 1.
--   - If y = 1 and x > 1, then x^(1) = 1^x forces x = 1, a contradiction. Similarly, if x = 1 and y > 1, then 1 = y^1 forces y = 1, a contradiction. So with x = 1 or y = 1, the only solution is (1, 1).
-- 
-- - Assume x > 1 and y > 1. Write prime factorizations y = ∏ p_i^{a_i} and x = ∏ p_i^{b_i} over the same set of primes (no new primes can appear on either side of x^(y^2) = y^x). Then
--   - x^(y^2) = ∏ p_i^{b_i y^2} and y^x = ∏ p_i^{a_i x},
--   - so equating exponents gives b_i y^2 = a_i x for every i with a_i > 0.
--   - Hence b_i/a_i = x/y^2 is the same constant c for all i, and therefore x = y^c with c = x/y^2 > 0 rational.
-- 
--   Substituting x = y^c into c = x/y^2 gives c = y^(c − 2).
--   Write c = p/q in lowest terms (p, q > 0, gcd(p, q) = 1). For x = y^{p/q} to be an integer, y must be a perfect q-th power: write y = z^q with integer z ≥ 2. Then
--     c = p/q = y^(c − 2) = (z^q)^{p/q − 2} = z^{p − 2q}.
--   Thus p/q = z^{p − 2q}. Consider three cases:
-- 
--   1) p − 2q = 0. Then z^{p − 2q} = z^0 = 1, so p/q = 1. But p − 2q = 0 also gives p = 2q, hence p/q = 2, a contradiction. No solutions here.
-- 
--   2) p − 2q > 0. Then z^{p − 2q} is an integer ≥ 2, so p/q is an integer, forcing q = 1 and c = p. The equation c = y^{c − 2} becomes
--      p = y^{p − 2} with y = z.
--      Checking possibilities:
--      - If p = 3, then y^{1} = 3, so y = 3 and x = y^p = 3^3 = 27.
--      - If p = 4, then y^{2} = 4, so y = 2 and x = y^p = 2^4 = 16.
--      - For p ≥ 5, y^{p − 2} grows too fast to equal the linear left-hand side p, so no further solutions.
-- 
--   3) p − 2q < 0. Let m = 2q − p > 0. Then p/q = z^{−m} = 1/z^m. Since p/q is in lowest terms, this forces p = 1 and q = z^m ≥ 2. Now
--      1/q = z^{p − 2q} = z^{1 − 2q} = 1/z^{2q − 1},
--      so q = z^{2q − 1}, which is impossible for integers z ≥ 2 and q ≥ 2. Thus no solutions arise in this case.
-- 
-- Therefore, the only solutions with x, y > 1 are (x, y) = (16, 2) and (27, 3), together with the trivial solution (1, 1).
-- 
-- 4. [Conclusion]
-- The only positive integer solutions to x^(y^2) = y^x are (1, 1), (16, 2), and (27, 3).
