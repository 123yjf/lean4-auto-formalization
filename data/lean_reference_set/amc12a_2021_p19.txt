-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Count the x in [0, π] satisfying sin((π/2) cos x) = cos((π/2) sin x).
-- 2. [Key Idea] Convert the cosine to a sine using cos y = sin(π/2 − y). Then both sine-arguments lie in the interval [−π/2, π/2], where sine is strictly increasing, so equality of the sines forces equality of the arguments. This reduces the problem to solving sin x + cos x = 1.
-- 3. [Proof] Step 1. Rewrite the right-hand side as a sine: cos((π/2) sin x) = sin(π/2 − (π/2) sin x) = sin((π/2)(1 − sin x)). The equation becomes sin((π/2) cos x) = sin((π/2)(1 − sin x)). Call the arguments A(x) = (π/2) cos x and B(x) = (π/2)(1 − sin x). Step 2. For x in [0, π], we have cos x in [−1, 1], so A(x) in [−π/2, π/2]; and sin x in [0, 1], so B(x) in [0, π/2]. Thus both A(x) and B(x) lie in [−π/2, π/2], where sine is strictly increasing (hence injective). Therefore sin(A(x)) = sin(B(x)) implies A(x) = B(x). This gives (π/2) cos x = (π/2)(1 − sin x), i.e. sin x + cos x = 1. Step 3. Solve sin x + cos x = 1 by writing sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x + π/4). Then √2 sin(x + π/4) = 1, so sin(x + π/4) = 1/√2 = sin(π/4). Hence x + π/4 = π/4 + 2kπ or x + π/4 = 3π/4 + 2kπ, giving x = 0 + 2kπ or x = π/2 + 2kπ. Restricting to [0, π] leaves x = 0 and x = π/2. Both satisfy the original equation: at x = 0, sin((π/2)·1) = 1 and cos((π/2)·0) = 1; at x = π/2, sin((π/2)·0) = 0 and cos((π/2)·1) = 0.
-- 4. [Conclusion] There are exactly two solutions in [0, π], namely x = 0 and x = π/2; the count is 2 (choice C).
