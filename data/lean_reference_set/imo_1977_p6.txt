-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that the only function f from the positive integers to the positive integers satisfying f(n + 1) > f(f(n)) for every positive integer n is the identity function f(n) = n.
-- 2. [Key Idea] First prove that f is strictly increasing and that f(1) = 1. From strict increase and the base value, deduce f(n) ≥ n for all n. Then use a minimal counterexample argument: if for the smallest k we had f(k) > k, the defining inequality would be violated, yielding a contradiction.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    a) Strict increase: Suppose, for contradiction, there is a smallest n with f(n + 1) ≤ f(n). Then on {1, …, n}, f is strictly increasing, so f(1) < … < f(n). The given condition implies f(n + 1) > f(f(n)), hence f(f(n)) < f(n + 1) ≤ f(n), so f(f(n)) < f(n). Since f is strictly increasing on {1, …, n}, this forces f(n) < n. Thus f(1) < … < f(n) ≤ n − 1, which is impossible because n distinct positive integers cannot all lie in {1, …, n − 1}. Hence f(n + 1) > f(n) for all n, i.e., f is strictly increasing.
--    b) Base value: Suppose, for contradiction, that f(1) ≥ 2. By strict increase, f(n) ≥ n + 1 for all n. Then f(n) ≥ n + 1 > n, and applying strict increase to the inputs yields f(f(n)) ≥ f(n + 1). But the defining inequality says f(n + 1) > f(f(n)), a contradiction. Therefore f(1) = 1.
--    c) Lower bound: From strict increase and f(1) = 1, it follows that f(n) ≥ n for all n.
--    d) Identity via minimal counterexample: Assume f is not the identity, and let k be the smallest positive integer with f(k) > k, so f(j) = j for all j < k and m := f(k) ≥ k + 1. Applying the inequality at n = k gives f(k + 1) > f(m). If m = k + 1, this says f(k + 1) > f(k + 1), impossible. If m > k + 1, strict increase gives f(k + 1) < f(m), contradicting f(k + 1) > f(m). Thus no such k exists, so f(k) = k for all k.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The function must be the identity: the only f with f(n + 1) > f(f(n)) for all positive integers n is f(n) = n.
