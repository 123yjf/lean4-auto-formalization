-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find distinct digits A, B, C in {1,…,9} such that (i) A + B = C, (ii) 11A − B = 2C, (iii) C·B = 11A + A (here AA denotes the two-digit number with both digits A, i.e., 11A). Compute A + B + C.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use A + B = C to eliminate C from (ii), obtaining a relation between A and B. Then apply the digit bounds (1–9) to restrict A, deduce C, and finally check (iii). Note that AA = 11A, so 11A + A = 12A, and CB means the product C·B.
-- 3. [Proof] From (i), C = A + B. Substitute into (ii): 11A − B = 2(A + B) ⇒ 11A − B = 2A + 2B ⇒ 9A − 3B = 0, hence B = 3A. Since B is a digit, 3A ≤ 9, so A ≤ 3. Using C = A + B = A + 3A = 4A, and C is a digit, we get 4A ≤ 9, so A ≤ 2. Test A = 1 and A = 2:
- If A = 1, then B = 3 and C = 4. Check (iii): C·B = 4·3 = 12, while 11A + A = 11·1 + 1 = 12, so it holds.
- If A = 2, then B = 6 and C = 8. Check (iii): C·B = 8·6 = 48, while 11A + A = 22 + 2 = 24, so it fails.
Thus the only solution is (A, B, C) = (1, 3, 4).
-- 4. [Conclusion] The unique solution yields A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.
