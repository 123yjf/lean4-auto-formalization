-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Solve for x in the equation (x − 9)/(x + 1) = 2.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Eliminate the denominator to turn the equation into a linear one, then isolate x.
-- 3. [Proof] Since the denominator cannot be zero, require x ≠ −1. Multiply both sides by (x + 1): x − 9 = 2(x + 1). Expand the right-hand side to get x − 9 = 2x + 2. Subtract x from both sides: −9 = x + 2. Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate x: x = −11.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The solution is x = −11, which is valid (it does not make the denominator zero), so it is the unique solution.
