-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine how many perfect-square divisors the number N = 1!·2!·3!·…·9! has.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Note that each integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 9) appears as a factor in exactly 10 − t of the factorials 1!, 2!, …, 9!, so N = ∏_{t=1}^{9} t^{10−t}. This lets us sum the total exponent of each prime across all t. A divisor is a perfect square exactly when each prime’s exponent is even, so for a prime power p^e there are floor(e/2) + 1 choices for its exponent (0, 2, …, 2·floor(e/2)).
-- 3. [Proof] 
   a) Prime exponents in N. For each prime p, its exponent in N is ∑_{t=1}^{9} v_p(t)·(10 − t), where v_p(t) is the exponent of p in t.
   - For p = 2, only t = 2, 4, 6, 8 contribute: v_2(2)=1, v_2(4)=2, v_2(6)=1, v_2(8)=3. Thus exponent of 2 is 1·8 + 2·6 + 1·4 + 3·2 = 8 + 12 + 4 + 6 = 30.
   - For p = 3, only t = 3, 6, 9 contribute: v_3(3)=1, v_3(6)=1, v_3(9)=2. Thus exponent of 3 is 1·7 + 1·4 + 2·1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13.
   - For p = 5, only t = 5 contributes with v_5(5)=1, giving exponent 1·5 = 5.
   - For p = 7, only t = 7 contributes with v_7(7)=1, giving exponent 1·3 = 3.
   Therefore N = 2^30 · 3^13 · 5^5 · 7^3.
   b) Counting square divisors. For p^e, the even exponents available are 0, 2, …, 2·floor(e/2), giving floor(e/2) + 1 choices. Hence the number of perfect-square divisors is:
   - For 2^30: floor(30/2) + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16
   - For 3^13: floor(13/2) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7
   - For 5^5: floor(5/2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
   - For 7^3: floor(3/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
   Multiply: 16 · 7 · 3 · 2 = 672.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Exactly 672 perfect-square divisors divide 1!·2!·3!·…·9!.
