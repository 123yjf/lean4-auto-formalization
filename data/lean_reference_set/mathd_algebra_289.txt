-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We have a quadratic x² − m x + n = 0 with positive integer roots k > t and prime coefficients m and n. Show that mⁿ + nᵐ + kᵗ + tᵏ equals 20.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use Vieta’s formulas: k + t = m and k t = n. Since n is prime, the product k t being prime forces one root to be 1 and the other to be that prime. Then requiring k + t to be prime restricts us to the unique pair (k, t) = (2, 1).
-- 3. [Proof] By Vieta, (i) k + t = m and (ii) k t = n. Because n is prime, the only way to write n as a product of two positive integers is 1 · n, so {k, t} = {n, 1}. Thus t = 1 and k = n. Then m = k + t = n + 1. For m to be prime, n + 1 must be prime. But for any odd prime n > 2, n + 1 is even and greater than 2, hence not prime. Therefore n must be 2, giving m = 3 and roots (k, t) = (2, 1). Substituting into the expression: mⁿ + nᵐ + kᵗ + tᵏ = 3² + 2³ + 2¹ + 1² = 9 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 20.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The only possible configuration is k = 2, t = 1, n = 2, m = 3, and thus mⁿ + nᵐ + kᵗ + tᵏ = 20.
