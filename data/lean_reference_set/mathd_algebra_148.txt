-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the constant c in f(x) = c x^3 − 9x + 3 given that f(2) = 9.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Substitute x = 2 into the polynomial and solve the resulting linear equation for c.
-- 3. [Proof] Evaluate f at x = 2: f(2) = c·2^3 − 9·2 + 3 = 8c − 18 + 3 = 8c − 15. Set this equal to 9: 8c − 15 = 9, so 8c = 24, hence c = 3.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The constant satisfying f(2) = 9 is c = 3.
