-- 1. [Problem Restatement] In an arithmetic progression with common difference 1, the sum of the first 98 terms is 137. Find the sum of the even-indexed terms a2 + a4 + ... + a98.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Write both the total sum of the first 98 terms and the sum of the even-indexed terms in terms of the first term a1, then eliminate a1 to get the desired sum.
-- 3. [Proof] Let the nth term be an = a1 + (n − 1). The sum of the first 98 terms is S98 = 98/2 * (2a1 + 97) = 49(2a1 + 97) = 137, so 2a1 + 97 = 137/49. This gives a1 = (137/49 − 97)/2 = −2308/49. For the even-indexed terms, write n = 2k with k = 1, ..., 49. Then a2k = a1 + (2k − 1), so
sum_{k=1}^{49} a2k = sum_{k=1}^{49} (a1 + 2k − 1) = 49(a1 − 1) + 2 * sum_{k=1}^{49} k = 49a1 − 49 + 2 * (49*50/2) = 49a1 + 2401.
Since 49a1 = −2308, we get 49a1 + 2401 = −2308 + 2401 = 93. (Alternatively, the 49 even-indexed terms exceed the 49 odd-indexed terms by exactly 49 since the common difference is 1; with total sum 137, the even-indexed sum is (137 + 49)/2 = 93.)
-- 4. [Conclusion] The sum of the even-indexed terms is 93.
