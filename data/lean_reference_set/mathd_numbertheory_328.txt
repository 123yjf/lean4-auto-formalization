-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the remainder when 5^999,999 is divided by 7.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Because 5 and 7 are coprime, Fermat’s Little Theorem gives 5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7). Thus we can reduce the exponent modulo 6.
-- 3. [Proof] Since 999,999 = 166,666·6 + 3, we have 999,999 mod 6 = 3. Therefore 5^999,999 ≡ 5^3 (mod 7). Compute 5^3 = 125, and 125 = 17·7 + 6, so 125 ≡ 6 (mod 7). Hence 5^999,999 ≡ 6 (mod 7).
-- 4. [Conclusion] The remainder when 5^999,999 is divided by 7 is 6.
