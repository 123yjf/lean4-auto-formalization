-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Compute f(f(1)) where f(x) = 1/(x + 2).
-- 2. [Key Idea] First evaluate f at 1, then apply f again to that result.
-- 3. [Proof] Step 1: f(1) = 1/(1 + 2) = 1/3. Step 2: f(f(1)) = f(1/3) = 1/(1/3 + 2) = 1/(1/3 + 6/3) = 1/(7/3) = 3/7.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Hence, f(f(1)) = 3/7.
