-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find three distinct positive integers whose product is 2001 and whose sum is as large as possible.
-- 2. [Key Idea] For a fixed product, making the factors more unequal increases their sum. Thus, to maximize the sum with three distinct positive integers, one factor should be 1; then choose the remaining two distinct factors of 2001 that multiply to 2001 and have the largest possible sum.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    Step 1 – Prime factorization: 2001 = 3 × 23 × 29.
--    Step 2 – One factor must be 1: Suppose (a, b, c) with a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ 1 and abc = 2001 maximizes the sum. If c > 1, replace (a, b, c) by (ac, b, 1). The new sum is (ac + b + 1) − (a + b + c) = (ac − a − c + 1) = (a − 1)(c − 1) > 0, since a ≥ 2 and c ≥ 2. This contradicts maximality, so c = 1 in any optimal triple.
--    Step 3 – Maximize the remaining pair: We need distinct a, b with ab = 2001 and a + b maximal. The factor pairs are:
--      • 3 × 667 → sum 670
--      • 23 × 87 → sum 110
--      • 29 × 69 → sum 98
--      • 1 × 2001 is disallowed (would give two 1’s in the triple, violating distinctness).
--    The maximum sum occurs at (3, 667).
--    Step 4 – Assemble the triple: (1, 3, 667), in any order. The sum is 1 + 3 + 667 = 671.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The maximum possible sum is 671.
