-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find real numbers a and b satisfying the system 3a + 2b = 5 and a + b = 2.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use elimination: combine the equations to cancel one variable and solve step by step.
-- 3. [Proof] Label the equations: (1) 3a + 2b = 5 and (2) a + b = 2. Double (2) to get 2a + 2b = 4. Subtract this from (1): (3a − 2a) + (2b − 2b) = 5 − 4, yielding a = 1. Substitute a = 1 into (2): 1 + b = 2, so b = 1. Therefore, (a, b) = (1, 1).
-- 4. [Conclusion] The system has the unique solution (a, b) = (1, 1).
