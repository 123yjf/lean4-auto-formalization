-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given V = 1 + i and Z = 2 − i, and the relation V = I Z, compute the current I.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Express I as V/Z and divide complex numbers by multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to clear the imaginary part from the denominator.
-- 3. [Proof] We have I = (1 + i)/(2 − i). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate 2 + i:
--    I = ((1 + i)(2 + i)) / ((2 − i)(2 + i)).
--    Compute the numerator: (1 + i)(2 + i) = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 2 + 3i − 1 = 1 + 3i.
--    Compute the denominator: (2 − i)(2 + i) = 2^2 − i^2 = 4 − (−1) = 5.
--    Therefore, I = (1 + 3i)/5 = 1/5 + (3/5)i.
--    As a polar check: |V| = sqrt(2), arg(V) = π/4; |Z| = sqrt(5), arg(Z) = −arctan(1/2). Hence |I| = sqrt(2)/sqrt(5) and arg(I) = π/4 + arctan(1/2). Converting back to rectangular form gives I = 1/5 + (3/5)i, agreeing with the algebraic result.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The current is I = 1/5 + (3/5)i.
