-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that if the number 2^n − 1 is prime, then the exponent n must be a prime number.
-- 2. [Key Idea] If n were composite, say n = ab with a, b > 1, then using the identity x^b − 1 = (x − 1)(x^{b−1} + ⋯ + x + 1) with x = 2^a would factor 2^n − 1 nontrivially. Equivalently, 2^a − 1 divides 2^{ab} − 1, contradicting primality.
-- 3. [Proof] Assume 2^n − 1 is prime. Suppose for contradiction that n is composite, so n = ab with integers a > 1 and b > 1. Let x = 2^a. Then 2^n − 1 = 2^{ab} − 1 = x^b − 1. By the factorization formula, x^b − 1 = (x − 1)(x^{b−1} + x^{b−2} + ⋯ + x + 1). Each factor is greater than 1: indeed, x − 1 = 2^a − 1 ≥ 3 − 1 = 2 > 1, and the sum x^{b−1} + ⋯ + 1 ≥ 1 + 1 = 2 > 1. Hence 2^n − 1 has a nontrivial factorization, contradicting its primality. Alternatively, since 2^a − 1 divides 2^{ab} − 1, we get 1 < 2^a − 1 < 2^n − 1, again contradicting primality.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore n cannot be composite; it must be prime. Thus, 2^n − 1 can be prime only when n is prime.
