-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Compute the value of (log base 2 of 80)/(log base 40 of 2) minus (log base 2 of 160)/(log base 20 of 2).
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the change-of-base formula to rewrite each denominator as a reciprocal of a base-2 logarithm. Then write each number as a power of 2 times 5 and set x = log base 2 of 5, so the whole expression becomes a simple polynomial in x.
-- 3. [Proof] Let x = log₂ 5.
   - First term:
     log₂ 80 = log₂(2⁴·5) = 4 + x.
     log₄₀ 2 = 1 / log₂ 40 = 1 / log₂(2³·5) = 1 / (3 + x).
     Hence (log₂ 80)/(log₄₀ 2) = (4 + x) · (3 + x).
   - Second term:
     log₂ 160 = log₂(2⁵·5) = 5 + x.
     log₂₀ 2 = 1 / log₂ 20 = 1 / log₂(2²·5) = 1 / (2 + x).
     Hence (log₂ 160)/(log₂₀ 2) = (5 + x) · (2 + x).
   - Difference:
     (4 + x)(3 + x) − (5 + x)(2 + x) = (12 + 7x + x²) − (10 + 7x + x²) = 2.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The expression equals 2, i.e., choice (D).
