-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that the finite sum of reciprocals of square roots satisfies Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k < 198.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Compare each term 1/√k to a simple telescoping difference involving square roots, or alternatively bound the sum by an integral of a decreasing function, and then evaluate the resulting expression.
-- 3. [Proof] Telescoping bound: For every integer k ≥ 2, note that 2(√k − √(k−1)) = 2/(√k + √(k−1)). Since √k + √(k−1) < 2√k, taking reciprocals gives 2/(√k + √(k−1)) > 1/√k. Therefore 1/√k < 2(√k − √(k−1)). Summing this strict inequality from k = 2 to 10000 yields Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k < 2 Σ_{k=2}^{10000} (√k − √(k−1)) = 2(√10000 − √1) by telescoping, which equals 2(100 − 1) = 198. Hence Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k < 198. Alternative integral bound: Because f(x) = 1/√x is positive and decreasing on [1, 10000], the sum satisfies Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k ≤ ∫_{1}^{10000} 1/√x dx = [2√x]_{1}^{10000} = 198, and the inequality is strict since the summands are not all equal to the integrand over intervals (the function is not constant).
-- 4. [Conclusion] Both the telescoping comparison and the integral comparison show that Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k is strictly less than 198.
