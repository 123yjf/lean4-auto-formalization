-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the units digit n such that the four-digit number 374n is divisible by 18.
-- 2. [Key Idea] A number is divisible by 18 exactly when it is divisible by both 2 and 9. These impose independent conditions on the last digit n.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - Divisibility by 2: The last digit must be even, so n ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.
--    - Divisibility by 9: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. For 374n, the digit sum is 3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n. We need 14 + n ≡ 0 (mod 9), i.e., n ≡ −14 ≡ −5 ≡ 4 (mod 9). Among digits 0–9, only n = 4 satisfies this.
--    - Combining both conditions, the only possible n is 4.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The required units digit is n = 4.
