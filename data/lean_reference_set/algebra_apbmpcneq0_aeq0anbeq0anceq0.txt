-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that if m³ = 2 and n³ = 4, then the only rational numbers a, b, c satisfying a + b m + c n = 0 are a = b = c = 0.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Note that n = m² (since 4 = 2²), so the relation becomes a + b m + c m² = 0. The minimal polynomial of m over ℚ is x³ − 2, which is irreducible, so {1, m, m²} is ℚ–linearly independent.
-- 3. [Proof] Method 1 (via minimal polynomial).
   • Since n = (4)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3} = m², the equation is a + b m + c m² = 0 with a, b, c ∈ ℚ.
   • This says m is a root of the polynomial q(x) = c x² + b x + a ∈ ℚ[x].
   • But the minimal polynomial of m over ℚ is x³ − 2, irreducible by Eisenstein’s criterion at p = 2, so any nonzero polynomial over ℚ that vanishes at m must have degree at least 3.
   • Hence q must be the zero polynomial, forcing a = b = c = 0.
  Method 2 (linear-independence/basis argument).
   • The field extension ℚ(m) has degree 3 over ℚ, so {1, m, m²} is a basis of ℚ(m) as a ℚ–vector space.
   • The relation a·1 + b·m + c·m² = 0 is a linear combination equal to zero in this basis.
   • Coefficients in a basis expansion are unique, so a = b = c = 0.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Because {1, m, m²} is ℚ–linearly independent, the equation a + b m + c n = 0 forces a = b = c = 0.
