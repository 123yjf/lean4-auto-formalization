-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6, and show that the remainder equals 5.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the division algorithm: write 1529 as 6 times a whole number plus a remainder between 0 and 5; equivalently, note that 1529 is one less than a multiple of 6.
-- 3. [Proof]
   Direct calculation:
   • Compute 6 × 254 = 1524.
   • Then 1529 − 1524 = 5, so 1529 = 6·254 + 5.
   • Therefore, the remainder upon dividing 1529 by 6 is 5, i.e., 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6).

   Alternative observation:
   • 1530 is divisible by 6 since 1530 = 6·255.
   • Because 1529 = 1530 − 1, we have 1529 ≡ −1 ≡ 5 (mod 6).
-- 4. [Conclusion] In both approaches, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.
