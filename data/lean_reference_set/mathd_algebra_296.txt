-- 1. [Problem Restatement] A 3491 × 3491 square is changed into a rectangle with side lengths (3491 − 60) and (3491 + 60). Find how much the area changes.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the difference-of-squares identity to compare areas, or view the alteration geometrically as cancelling equal strips except for a 60 × 60 overlap.
-- 3. [Proof] 
   Algebraic approach: The original area is 3491². The new area is (3491 − 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491² − 60² by the identity (a − b)(a + b) = a² − b². Therefore, the change in area is (3491² − 60²) − 3491² = −60² = −3600, so the area decreases by 3600.
   Geometric approach: Removing a strip of width 60 from one side reduces area by 60 × 3491, and attaching that strip to the adjacent side adds 60 × 3491, so these cancel. However, the reattachment creates a 60 × 60 overlap that must be discarded, leaving a net loss of 60² = 3600.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The area decreases by exactly 3600 square units.
