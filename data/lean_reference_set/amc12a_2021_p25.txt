-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We want the unique positive integer N that maximizes f(n) = d(n) / n^(1/3), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n. Then we must find the sum of the digits of that N.
-- 2. [Key Idea] If n = ∏ p^a (over primes p), then d(n) = ∏ (a + 1) and n^(1/3) = ∏ p^(a/3), so f(n) = ∏ (a + 1) / p^(a/3). Increasing the exponent of a single prime p from a to a + 1 multiplies f by ((a + 2)/(a + 1)) / p^(1/3). We should keep increasing that exponent as long as this multiplier exceeds 1. This yields, for each prime, a maximal exponent determined by the inequality (a + 2)/(a + 1) > p^(1/3). Because the effect factorizes over primes, this determines N uniquely.
-- 3. [Proof] Write n = ∏ p_i^(a_i) with p_1 = 2 < p_2 = 3 < …, so f(n) = ∏ (a_i + 1) / p_i^(a_i/3).
   Step-up criterion: If we increase a_j by 1, then f is multiplied by M_j = ((a_j + 2)/(a_j + 1)) / p_j^(1/3). Thus f increases exactly when (a_j + 2)/(a_j + 1) > p_j^(1/3). At the maximizing N, this strict inequality must fail for every prime factor, so the optimal a_j is the largest integer for which the strict inequality still holds.
   Apply this prime by prime:
   - p = 2, 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26. Check a = 0: 2/1.26 > 1; a = 1: 1.5/1.26 > 1; a = 2: 1.333…/1.26 > 1; a = 3: 1.25/1.26 < 1. Stop at a_2 = 3.
   - p = 3, 3^(1/3) ≈ 1.44. Check a = 0: 2/1.44 > 1; a = 1: 1.5/1.44 > 1; a = 2: 1.333…/1.44 < 1. Stop at a_3 = 2.
   - p = 5, 5^(1/3) ≈ 1.71. Check a = 0: 2/1.71 > 1; a = 1: 1.5/1.71 < 1. Stop at a_5 = 1.
   - p = 7, 7^(1/3) ≈ 1.91. Check a = 0: 2/1.91 > 1; a = 1: 1.5/1.91 < 1. Stop at a_7 = 1.
   - For p ≥ 11, p^(1/3) ≥ 11^(1/3) ≈ 2.22, so already at a = 0 we have 2/2.22 < 1, hence no larger prime appears.
   Therefore N = 2^3 · 3^2 · 5^1 · 7^1 = 2520. Uniqueness follows because, for each prime, the exponent is forced to be the largest one for which the inequality holds; these choices are independent and thus determine a unique product.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The maximizing integer is N = 2520, whose digit sum is 2 + 5 + 2 + 0 = 9.
