-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the units (ones) digit of the product 1·3·5·7·9·11.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Work modulo 10, since the units digit depends only on the residue mod 10. Among the factors there is exactly one multiple of 5 (namely 5) and all factors are odd, so the product has a single factor 5 and no factor 2. A number divisible by 5 but not by 2 must end in 5.
-- 3. [Proof] Direct computation mod 10: 1·3 ≡ 3; then 3·5 ≡ 15 ≡ 5; once the running product is 5, multiplying by any odd number keeps it 5 mod 10: 5·7 ≡ 35 ≡ 5, 5·9 ≡ 45 ≡ 5, 5·11 ≡ 55 ≡ 5. Thus the product is congruent to 5 mod 10. Structural argument: the units digit is determined mod 10; the product’s prime factors include one 5 and no 2s; being divisible by 5 forces the last digit to be 0 or 5, and not having a factor 2 rules out 0, so it must be 5.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The product 1·3·5·7·9·11 has units digit 5.
