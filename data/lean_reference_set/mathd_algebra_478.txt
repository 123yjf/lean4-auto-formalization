-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Compute the volume of a cone given that its base area is 30 square units and its height is 6.5 units.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Apply the cone volume formula V = (1/3) × B × h, where B is the base area and h is the height.
-- 3. [Proof] Substitute B = 30 and h = 6.5 into the formula: V = (1/3) × 30 × 6.5 = 10 × 6.5 = 65.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The volume of the cone is 65 cubic units.
