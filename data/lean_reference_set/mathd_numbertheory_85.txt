-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Convert the base-three number 1222₃ to its base-ten value.
-- 2. [Key Idea] View a base-three numeral as a sum of its digits times powers of 3, or equivalently compute left-to-right by repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding the next digit.
-- 3. [Proof] Standard expansion: 1222₃ = 1·3^3 + 2·3^2 + 2·3^1 + 2·3^0 = 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53. Alternatively, left-to-right accumulation: start at 0; (0·3 + 1) = 1; (1·3 + 2) = 5; (5·3 + 2) = 17; (17·3 + 2) = 53. Thus 1222₃ = 53₁₀.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The number 1222 in base three equals 53 in base ten.
