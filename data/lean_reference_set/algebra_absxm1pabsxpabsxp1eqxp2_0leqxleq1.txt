-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that if a real number x satisfies |x − 1| + |x| + |x + 1| = x + 2, then necessarily 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the triangle inequality to bound |x − 1| + |x + 1| from below, identify when equality occurs in that bound, and combine this with the given equation to pin down x.
-- 3. [Proof] 
   Method 1 (Triangle-inequality squeeze)
   a. By the triangle inequality, |x − 1| + |x + 1| ≥ |(x − 1) − (x + 1)| = 2. Therefore |x − 1| + |x| + |x + 1| ≥ |x| + 2. 
   b. The hypothesis says |x − 1| + |x| + |x + 1| = x + 2. Comparing with the inequality above gives |x| + 2 = x + 2, so |x| = x, hence x ≥ 0.
   c. Equality in |x − 1| + |x + 1| ≥ 2 holds exactly when x − 1 and −(x + 1) point in the same direction, i.e., (x − 1)(x + 1) ≤ 0, which means −1 ≤ x ≤ 1.
   d. Intersecting x ≥ 0 and −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 yields 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
   
   Method 2 (Direct piecewise check)
   Split the real line at −1, 0, and 1. On [0, 1], we have |x − 1| = 1 − x, |x| = x, and |x + 1| = x + 1, so the sum is (1 − x) + x + (x + 1) = x + 2, matching the right-hand side. On the other intervals, direct evaluation shows the left-hand side exceeds x + 2, so the equation does not hold.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The identity |x − 1| + |x| + |x + 1| = x + 2 holds precisely for x in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
