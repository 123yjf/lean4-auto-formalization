-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that for every integer n ≥ 1 and every real x > −1, the inequality 1 + n x ≤ (1 + x)^n holds.
-- 2. [Key Idea] This is Bernoulli’s inequality. One can prove it by induction on n for all x > −1, and, in the special case x ≥ 0, by the binomial expansion since all higher-order terms are nonnegative.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    Proof 1 (induction on n):
--    • Base case n = 1: 1 + 1·x = 1 + x = (1 + x)^1, so the statement holds.
--    • Inductive step: assume 1 + n x ≤ (1 + x)^n. Then
--      1 + (n + 1) x = (1 + n x) + x ≤ (1 + x)^n + x.
--      It remains to show (1 + x)^n + x ≤ (1 + x)^{n+1} = (1 + x)^n (1 + x).
--      Subtracting (1 + x)^n from both sides, this is equivalent to x ≤ x (1 + x)^n.
--      Because x > −1, there are two subcases:
--      – If x ≥ 0, then (1 + x)^n ≥ 1, so x ≤ x (1 + x)^n is immediate.
--      – If −1 < x < 0, then 0 < 1 + x < 1, hence (1 + x)^n ≤ 1. Dividing the desired inequality by x (which is negative) reverses the inequality, giving 1 ≥ (1 + x)^n, which is true. Thus x ≤ x (1 + x)^n holds.
--      This completes the induction.
--    Proof 2 (binomial expansion, valid when x ≥ 0):
--    Expand (1 + x)^n = 1 + n x + C(n,2) x^2 + … + C(n,n) x^n. For x ≥ 0, every term beyond 1 + n x is nonnegative, so (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + n x.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, for all integers n ≥ 1 and all real x > −1, the inequality 1 + n x ≤ (1 + x)^n holds (by induction in general, and also by binomial expansion when x ≥ 0).
