-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the distance between the two points where the parabola y = x^2 intersects the line x + y = 1.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Solve the system by substituting y = 1 − x into y = x^2 to obtain the two intersection points. Then use the distance formula. Because the line has slope −1, the absolute differences in x and y between the points are equal, which simplifies the computation.
-- 3. [Proof] Substitute y = 1 − x into y = x^2 to get x^2 = 1 − x, i.e., x^2 + x − 1 = 0. Solving this quadratic gives x = (−1 ± √5)/2. The corresponding y-values are y = 1 − x, so the two intersection points are P₁ = ((−1 + √5)/2, (3 − √5)/2) and P₂ = ((−1 − √5)/2, (3 + √5)/2). The coordinate differences are Δx = ((−1 + √5)/2) − ((−1 − √5)/2) = √5 and Δy = ((3 − √5)/2) − ((3 + √5)/2) = −√5. Therefore, the distance between the points is √[(Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2] = √[(√5)^2 + (−√5)^2] = √(5 + 5) = √10. Geometric check: since the line x + y = 1 has slope −1, the segment connecting the intersection points is parallel to it, so the absolute differences in x and y match, consistent with the calculation.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The distance between the two intersection points is √10.
