-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the coefficient B in the polynomial z^6 − 10 z^5 + A z^4 + B z^3 + C z^2 + D z + 16, given that all six roots are positive integers (counted with multiplicity).
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use Viète’s formulas: the sum of the roots is 10 and their product is 16. Since 16 = 2^4, the roots must be powers of 2. Enumerating six positive integers with sum 10 and product 16 yields a unique multiset of roots, from which the third elementary symmetric sum S3 (and hence B = −S3) can be computed.
-- 3. [Proof] Let the roots be r1, …, r6 ∈ ℕ. By Viète’s formulas:
   (i) r1 + ⋯ + r6 = 10,
   (ii) r1 r2 ⋯ r6 = 16,
   (iii) the coefficient of z^3 equals (−1)^3 S3 = −S3, where S3 is the sum of all triple products r_i r_j r_k with i < j < k. Thus B = −S3.

   Because 16 = 2^4 and all roots are positive integers, each root must be a power of 2. Values larger than 4 (namely 8 or 16) would make the sum exceed 10, so the only possibilities are 1, 2, and 4. Let a, b, c be the counts of 4’s, 2’s, and 1’s respectively, so a + b + c = 6.

   The product condition gives 4^a · 2^b = 16, i.e., 2a + b = 4.
   The sum condition gives 4a + 2b + c = 10, and since c = 6 − a − b, this simplifies to 3a + b = 4.
   Subtracting the two equations yields a = 0, hence b = 4 and c = 2. Therefore the multiset of roots is uniquely {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2}.

   Compute S3 by counting triple products:
   - Triples with no 1’s: choose 3 of the 4 twos, C(4,3) = 4 triples, each product 2·2·2 = 8, contributing 4·8 = 32.
   - Triples with exactly one 1: choose 1 of the 2 ones and 2 of the 4 twos, 2·C(4,2) = 12 triples, each product 1·2·2 = 4, contributing 12·4 = 48.
   - Triples with exactly two 1’s: choose both ones and 1 of the 4 twos, 4 triples, each product 1·1·2 = 2, contributing 4·2 = 8.

   Thus S3 = 32 + 48 + 8 = 88, and therefore B = −S3 = −88.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The unique multiset of roots is {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2}, which gives S3 = 88, so B = −88.
