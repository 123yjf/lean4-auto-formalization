-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the least positive integer n such that the two consecutive Euler values n² − n + 41 and (n+1)² − (n+1) + 41 have a common divisor larger than 1.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Use the fact that p(n+1) − p(n) = 2n to rewrite the common divisor as gcd(p(n), 2n). Since p(n) is always odd, any common divisor must be odd and thus divide n; reducing p(n) modulo any such odd prime shows it must also divide 41. Therefore n must be a multiple of 41, and the smallest such n is 41.
-- 3. [Proof] Let p(n) = n² − n + 41 and let d = gcd(p(n), p(n+1)). Because p(n+1) − p(n) = 2n, we have d = gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n). Now n² − n is even, so p(n) is odd; hence d, which divides p(n), is also odd. Therefore 2 ∤ d and any prime factor of d must divide n (since d | 2n and d is odd). Let q be an odd prime with q | d. Then q | n and q | p(n). Writing n = qk, we get p(n) = q²k² − qk + 41 ≡ 41 (mod q), so q | 41. The only odd prime dividing 41 is 41 itself; thus every common divisor greater than 1 must be a power of 41, forcing n to be a multiple of 41. The smallest positive such n is 41. Checking: p(41) = 41² − 41 + 41 = 41² and p(42) = 42² − 42 + 41 = 41·43, so gcd(p(41), p(42)) = 41. For any 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, n is not a multiple of 41, so no common divisor greater than 1 can occur.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The least positive integer n for which p(n) and p(n+1) share a factor greater than 1 is n = 41.
