-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the smallest positive integer k such that, for every positive integer n, each of the numbers 6n+3, 6n+2, and 6n+1 is coprime to 6n+k. Prove that this least k is 5.
-- 2. [Key Idea] If k shares a factor with 2 (present in 6n+2) or with 3 (present in 6n+3), then 6n+k will not be coprime to one of those numbers. Thus k must be coprime to 6, i.e., k ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6). The smallest candidate k = 1 fails immediately; the next candidate k = 5 works.
-- 3. [Proof] Necessity: 
   a) If 2 divides k, then 2 divides both 6n+2 and 6n+k, so gcd(6n+2, 6n+k) ≥ 2 ≠ 1. 
   b) If 3 divides k, then 3 divides both 6n+3 and 6n+k, so gcd(6n+3, 6n+k) ≥ 3 ≠ 1. 
   Therefore k must be coprime to 6, hence k ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6). The first such value is k = 1, but then 6n+k = 6n+1, so gcd(6n+1, 6n+1) = 6n+1 > 1, and k = 1 fails. Thus k ≥ 5.
   Sufficiency for k = 5: Let k = 5 and n be any positive integer.
   (i) gcd(6n+5, 6n+3) = gcd((6n+5) − (6n+3), 6n+3) = gcd(2, 6n+3). Since 6n+3 is odd, this gcd is 1.
   (ii) gcd(6n+5, 6n+2) = gcd((6n+5) − (6n+2), 6n+2) = gcd(3, 6n+2). Because 6n ≡ 0 (mod 3), we have 6n+2 ≡ 2 (mod 3), so the gcd is 1.
   (iii) gcd(6n+5, 6n+1) = gcd((6n+5) − (6n+1), 6n+1) = gcd(4, 6n+1). Now 6n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 4) depending on whether n is even or odd, so 6n+1 ≡ 1 or 3 (mod 4), and in either case gcd(4, 6n+1) = 1.
   Hence for k = 5, all three gcds equal 1 for every positive n.
   Minimality: We have ruled out k = 1 by identity, and k = 2, 3, 4 by divisibility by 2 or 3. Therefore the smallest admissible k is 5.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The least positive integer k for which 6n+3, 6n+2, and 6n+1 are all coprime to 6n+k for every positive integer n is k = 5.
