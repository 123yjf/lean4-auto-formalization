-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that the biconditional “a and b are both even iff 8 divides a^2 + b^2” does not hold for all integers a, b.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Squares modulo 8 can only be 0, 1, or 4. From this, if 8 divides a^2 + b^2, neither square can be 1 modulo 8, so both a and b must be even. However, evenness of a and b alone does not ensure that a^2 + b^2 is divisible by 8.
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - Squares mod 8: For any integer n, the residues 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 modulo 8 square to 0,1,4,1,0,1,4,1, respectively. Thus n^2 ≡ 0 or 4 (mod 8) if n is even, and n^2 ≡ 1 (mod 8) if n is odd.
--    - Forward direction fails: Let a = 2 and b = 0, both even. Then a^2 + b^2 = 4, which is not divisible by 8. Hence “both even ⇒ 8 | (a^2 + b^2)” is false.
--    - Converse holds: If 8 divides a^2 + b^2, then a^2 + b^2 ≡ 0 (mod 8). If a were odd, then a^2 ≡ 1 (mod 8), forcing b^2 ≡ 7 (mod 8), impossible. So a is even; by the same reasoning, b is even. Therefore 8 | (a^2 + b^2) ⇒ a and b are even.
--    - A single counterexample like (a, b) = (2, 0) already disproves the biconditional.
-- 4. [Conclusion] Because the forward implication fails (e.g., 2^2 + 0^2 = 4), the statement “a and b are both even iff 8 divides a^2 + b^2” is false for all integers a, b.
