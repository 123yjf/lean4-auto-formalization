-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Compute √1,000,000 − ³√1,000,000.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Write 1,000,000 as 10^6 so that taking square and cube roots becomes simple exponent arithmetic.
-- 3. [Proof] Let N = 1,000,000 = 10^6. Then √N = (10^6)^(1/2) = 10^(6/2) = 10^3 = 1000, and ³√N = (10^6)^(1/3) = 10^(6/3) = 10^2 = 100. Hence √1,000,000 − ³√1,000,000 = 1000 − 100 = 900. Alternatively, factor N = 2^6 · 5^6. Then √N = 2^3 · 5^3 = 8 · 125 = 1000 and ³√N = 2^2 · 5^2 = 4 · 25 = 100, so the difference is 900.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The value is 900.
