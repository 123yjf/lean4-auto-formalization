-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the smallest positive integer X such that X ≡ 2 (mod 3) and the last digit of X matches the last digit of some integer congruent to 4 modulo 5.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Any integer ≡ 4 (mod 5) has last digit 4 or 9, so X must end in 4 or 9. Check the smallest numbers with these endings against X ≡ 2 (mod 3).
-- 3. [Proof] 
--    - Possible last digits are 4 or 9 (since 4 ≡ 4 (mod 5) and 9 ≡ 4 (mod 5)).
--    - Test small candidates:
--      • 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3): fails
--      • 9 ≡ 0 (mod 3): fails
--      • 14 ≡ 2 (mod 3): succeeds
--    - Therefore, 14 satisfies both conditions, and anything smaller (4 or 9) does not.
--    - Alternative: Let X = 10k + d with d ∈ {4, 9}. Since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we have k + d ≡ 2 (mod 3).
--      • If d = 4: k ≡ 1 (mod 3) → smallest k = 1 → X = 14.
--      • If d = 9: k ≡ 2 (mod 3) → smallest k = 2 → X = 29.
--      The smallest across cases is 14.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The least positive integer satisfying the conditions is 14.
