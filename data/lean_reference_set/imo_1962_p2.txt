-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find all real x such that √(√(3 − x) − √(x + 1)) > 1/2.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Square once to reduce the inequality, analyze the resulting function which is strictly decreasing on its domain, and solve the single boundary equation to find the unique cutoff point.
-- 3. [Proof] (a) Domain. For the square roots to be real and the inner difference to be nonnegative, we need 3 − x ≥ 0, x + 1 ≥ 0, and √(3 − x) ≥ √(x + 1). These give x ≤ 3, x ≥ −1, and 3 − x ≥ x + 1 ⇒ x ≤ 1. Hence the domain is −1 ≤ x ≤ 1. (b) First squaring. Since the inner difference is nonnegative on the domain, √(√(3 − x) − √(x + 1)) > 1/2 is equivalent to √(3 − x) − √(x + 1) > 1/4. Call this inequality (∗). (c) Boundary point. Let s = √(3 − x) and t = √(x + 1) (so s, t ≥ 0). Then s − t = 1/4 and s² + t² = (3 − x) + (x + 1) = 4. Substituting s = t + 1/4 into s² + t² = 4 yields (t + 1/4)² + t² = 4 ⇒ 2t² + (1/2)t + 1/16 = 4 ⇒ 32t² + 8t − 63 = 0. Solving gives t = (−1 ± √127)/8, and only the positive root is admissible: t = (−1 + √127)/8. Thus √(x + 1) = (−1 + √127)/8, so x + 1 = (128 − 2√127)/64 = 2 − √127/32, hence x₀ = 1 − √127/32. (d) Monotonicity. Define f(x) = √(3 − x) − √(x + 1) on [−1, 1]. Then f′(x) = −1/(2√(3 − x)) − 1/(2√(x + 1)) < 0, so f is strictly decreasing. Since f(−1) = 2 > 1/4 and f(x₀) = 1/4, inequality (∗) holds for all x < x₀ and fails for x > x₀. (e) Collecting conditions. Intersecting with the domain −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, the solution set is [−1, 1 − √127/32). (A geometric view: the pair (s, t) lies on the circle s² + t² = 4 and above the line s − t = 1/4; they intersect once, giving the same x₀, and monotonicity then yields the interval to its left.)
-- 4. [Conclusion] The solution set is exactly x ∈ [−1, 1 − √127/32).
