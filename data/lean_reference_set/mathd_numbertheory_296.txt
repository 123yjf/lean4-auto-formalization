-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the least integer greater than 1 that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Any integer that is simultaneously a cube and a fourth power must be a twelfth power, and the smallest nontrivial twelfth power is 2^12.
-- 3. [Proof] Let n be a positive integer with n = a^3 and n = b^4.
--    (i) Common-exponent argument:
--    • Since n = a^3, every prime exponent in the prime factorization of n is a multiple of 3.
--    • Since n = b^4, those exponents are also multiples of 4.
--    • Therefore each exponent is a multiple of lcm(3, 4) = 12, so n = c^12 for some integer c.
--    (ii) Minimality:
--    • The smallest integer greater than 1 of the form c^12 occurs when c = 2, giving n = 2^12 = 4096.
--    • Check: 4096 = 16^3 (a cube) and 4096 = 8^4 (a fourth power). No smaller integer works, because any candidate must be a twelfth power and c ≥ 2.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The smallest integer other than 1 that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096.
