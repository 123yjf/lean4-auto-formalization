-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We are given a function defined by f(n) = n − 3 for n ≥ 1000 and f(n) = f(f(n + 5)) for n < 1000. Determine the value of f(84).
-- 2. [Key Idea] For inputs below 1000, the function has a McCarthy-style recursive definition. One can show by downward induction that for all n < 1000, the value of f(n) depends only on the parity of n: f(n) = 997 when n is even and f(n) = 998 when n is odd.
-- 3. [Proof] We prove the following claim: for every integer n,
--    a) if n ≥ 1000, then f(n) = n − 3;
--    b) if n < 1000, then f(n) = 997 when n is even, and f(n) = 998 when n is odd.
--    We proceed by downward induction for n < 1000.
--    Base cases:
--    - For n = 999 (odd): f(999) = f(f(1004)) = f(1001) = 1001 − 3 = 998.
--    - For n = 998 (even): f(998) = f(f(1003)) = f(1000) = 1000 − 3 = 997.
--    Thus the claim holds for n = 998 and n = 999.
--    Inductive step: Assume the claim holds for all k with n < k < 1000. We prove it for such an n < 1000.
--    Case 1: n ≥ 995. Then n + 5 ≥ 1000, so f(n) = f(f(n + 5)) = f(n + 2). Since n + 2 is between n and 1000, the induction hypothesis applies to n + 2, and parity is preserved from n to n + 2. Therefore, f(n) = 997 if n is even, and f(n) = 998 if n is odd.
--    Case 2: n ≤ 994. Then n + 5 < 1000, so by the induction hypothesis, f(n + 5) = 997 if n + 5 is even, and f(n + 5) = 998 if n + 5 is odd. But n + 5 has the opposite parity of n. Therefore:
--      • If n is even, then n + 5 is odd, so f(n + 5) = 998, hence f(n) = f(998) = 997.
--      • If n is odd, then n + 5 is even, so f(n + 5) = 997, hence f(n) = f(997) = 998.
--    This completes the induction and establishes the parity rule for all n < 1000.
--    Consequently, for all n < 1000, f(n) = 997 when n is even, and f(n) = 998 when n is odd. Since 84 < 1000 and 84 is even, we get f(84) = 997.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The value is f(84) = 997.
