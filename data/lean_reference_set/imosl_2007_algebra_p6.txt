-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given real numbers a₁, …, a₁₀₀ with sum of squares ∑ aᵢ² = 1 (indices cyclic modulo 100), study the cyclic sum S = ∑ aᵢ² aᵢ₊₁. The text aims at the claimed bound S < 12/25 but ultimately establishes the standard bound S < 1/2.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Apply Cauchy–Schwarz to get S² ≤ ∑ aᵢ² aᵢ₊₁². Set xᵢ = aᵢ² (so xᵢ ≥ 0 and ∑ xᵢ = 1) to reduce to maximizing T = ∑ xᵢ xᵢ₊₁ on the simplex. Because T is a bilinear form and the domain is a simplex, the maximum occurs at an extreme point: at most two coordinates are nonzero, and to contribute they must be adjacent. This yields T ≤ 1/4, hence |S| ≤ 1/2. A quick check of the equality conditions shows they are incompatible across the two steps, so in fact |S| < 1/2 (thus S < 1/2).
-- 3. [Proof] Let S = ∑ aᵢ² aᵢ₊₁. By Cauchy–Schwarz with uᵢ = aᵢ and vᵢ = aᵢ aᵢ₊₁, we have
--    S² ≤ (∑ aᵢ²)(∑ (aᵢ aᵢ₊₁)²) = ∑ aᵢ² aᵢ₊₁².
--    Put xᵢ = aᵢ² ≥ 0 with ∑ xᵢ = 1. Then S² ≤ T where T = ∑ xᵢ xᵢ₊₁.
--    To maximize T under xᵢ ≥ 0 and ∑ xᵢ = 1, note T is linear on each face of the simplex, so a maximum occurs at an extreme point where at most two xᵢ are nonzero. If only one xᵢ is nonzero, then T = 0. If two are nonzero but not adjacent, T = 0. If two adjacent entries xⱼ and xⱼ₊₁ are nonzero with xⱼ + xⱼ₊₁ = 1, then T = xⱼ xⱼ₊₁ ≤ 1/4 by AM–GM, with equality at xⱼ = xⱼ₊₁ = 1/2. Therefore T ≤ 1/4, hence |S| ≤ 1/2.
--    Equality |S| = 1/2 would require equality in both steps. Equality in Cauchy–Schwarz forces aᵢ aᵢ₊₁ = c for a constant c whenever aᵢ ≠ 0. Equality T = 1/4 forces exactly two adjacent x’s equal to 1/2 and all others zero, so only two adjacent a’s are nonzero. Then from the next index, aᵢ₊₁ aᵢ₊₂ = c with aᵢ₊₂ = 0 forces c = 0, contradicting aᵢ aᵢ₊₁ = c with both nonzero. Hence simultaneous equality is impossible, and we get |S| < 1/2, in particular S < 1/2.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The argument proves the strict bound S < 1/2. This does not reach the stronger numerical bound 12/25 = 0.48; rather, it suggests that 1/2 is the natural target obtainable by these standard methods, and the statement with 12/25 likely requires different ideas or reflects a typo in the original problem.
