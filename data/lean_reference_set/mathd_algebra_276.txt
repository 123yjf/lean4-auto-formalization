-- 1. [Problem Restatement] We want to factor the quadratic 10x^2 − x − 24 in the form (A x − 8)(B x + 3) with integers A and B, and then compute the value of AB + B.
-- 2. [Key Idea] Expand the product (A x − 8)(B x + 3) and equate its coefficients with those of 10x^2 − x − 24. This yields the system AB = 10 and 3A − 8B = −1, which determines A and B.
-- 3. [Proof] Expanding, (A x − 8)(B x + 3) = AB x^2 + (3A − 8B) x − 24. Matching coefficients with 10x^2 − x − 24 gives: (i) AB = 10 and (ii) 3A − 8B = −1. The integer pairs with product 10 are (1, 10), (2, 5), (5, 2), (10, 1), and their negatives. Testing the positive pairs in (ii): for (1,10), 3·1 − 8·10 = −77 ≠ −1; for (2,5), 6 − 40 = −34 ≠ −1; for (5,2), 15 − 16 = −1, which works; for (10,1), 30 − 8 = 22 ≠ −1. Negative pairs yield 3A − 8B = 1, not −1, so they do not work. Therefore A = 5 and B = 2. Then AB + B = 10 + 2 = 12.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The required value is 12.
