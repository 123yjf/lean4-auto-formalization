-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given integers p, q, r with 1 < p < q < r and (p − 1)(q − 1)(r − 1) dividing pqr − 1, show that the only possible triples are (2,4,8) and (3,5,15).
-- 2. [Key Idea] Set a = p − 1, b = q − 1, c = r − 1 so that 1 ≤ a < b < c. Then pqr − 1 = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) − 1 = ab + ac + bc + a + b + c. The divisibility condition becomes abc dividing S := ab + ac + bc + a + b + c. A necessary condition is S ≥ abc. Checking cases a = 1 and a = 2 yields the two listed solutions; for a ≥ 3 one shows S < abc, so no solutions occur.
-- 3. [Proof]
--    - Substitute a = p − 1, b = q − 1, c = r − 1. Then a, b, c are positive integers with a < b < c, and the condition is abc | (ab + ac + bc + a + b + c). Let S = ab + ac + bc + a + b + c. If S < abc, divisibility is impossible since S is a positive integer smaller than its proposed divisor abc. We split by a.
--    - Case a = 1. Then abc = bc and S = bc + 2b + 2c + 1, so bc divides (2b + 2c + 1).
--      • If b ≥ 4, then with c ≥ b + 1 we have bc − (2b + 2c + 1) = (b − 2)(c − 2) − 5 ≥ 2·3 − 5 = 1, so 0 < 2b + 2c + 1 < bc, impossible.
--      • If b = 2, then c ≥ 3 and 2c | (2c + 5), which is impossible since 2c > 5.
--      • If b = 3, then c ≥ 4 and 3c | (2c + 7). Thus 3c ≤ 2c + 7, giving c ≤ 7. Checking c = 4,5,6,7 shows only c = 7 works. Hence (a,b,c) = (1,3,7), i.e. (p,q,r) = (2,4,8).
--    - Case a = 2. Then abc = 2bc and S = bc + 3b + 3c + 2. The condition 2bc | S means there exists k ≥ 1 with
--        2k·bc = bc + 3b + 3c + 2,
--      so (2k − 1) bc = 3b + 3c + 2, hence
--        c = (3b + 2)/((2k − 1) b − 3).
--      Since c > b ≥ 3, the denominator must be positive. If k ≥ 2, then (2k − 1) b − 3 ≥ 3b − 3, which makes c < 2 for b ≥ 3, impossible. Thus k = 1, giving
--        c = (3b + 2)/(b − 3) = 3 + 11/(b − 3).
--      Hence b − 3 divides 11. With b > 3 and c > b, the only possibility is b − 3 = 1, so b = 4 and c = 14. This yields (a,b,c) = (2,4,14), i.e. (p,q,r) = (3,5,15).
--    - Case a ≥ 3. Then b ≥ 4 and c ≥ 5. Consider
--        abc − S = abc − (ab + ac + bc + a + b + c) = c(ab − a − b) − (ab + a + b + c).
--      For a ≥ 3 and b ≥ 4, we have ab − a − b − 1 = (a − 1)(b − 1) − 2 ≥ 4, so ab − a − b ≥ 5. Thus
--        abc − S ≥ c·5 − (ab + a + b + c) = 4c − (ab + a + b).
--      Taking the minimal c = b + 1 one checks more sharply that
--        abc − S ≥ (b + 1)(ab − a − b − 1) − (ab + a + b) ≥ b·4 − (2a + 2b + 1) = 2b − 2a − 1 ≥ 1
--      (using a ≥ 3 and b ≥ 4). Hence abc − S > 0, so S < abc and divisibility fails.
--    - Therefore, only the solutions found in the cases a = 1 and a = 2 remain.
-- 4. [Conclusion] The only triples (p, q, r) with 1 < p < q < r and (p − 1)(q − 1)(r − 1) dividing pqr − 1 are (2,4,8) and (3,5,15).
