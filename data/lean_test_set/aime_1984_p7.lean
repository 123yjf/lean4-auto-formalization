-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the value of f(84) for the function f(n)= n−3 (n ≥ 1000) and f(n)=f(f(n+5)) (n<1000). 2. [Key Idea] Below 1000 the definition is McCarthy-like; a short induction shows that f(n) depends only on the parity of n: even n give 997, odd n give 998. 3. [Proof] Claim. For every integer n a) if n ≥ 1000, f(n)=n−3; b) if n<1000, f(n)=997 when n is even, and 998 when n is odd. Proof by downward induction on n<1000. Base cases. n=999 (odd): f(999)=f(f(1004))=f(1001)=1001−3=998. n=998 (even): f(998)=f(f(1003))=f(1000)=1000−3=997. Thus the claim holds for 998 and 999. Inductive step. Assume the claim is true for all k with n<k<1000. Consider such an n (n<1000). Case 1: n ≥ 995. Then n+5 ≥ 1000, so f(n)=f(f(n+5))=f(n+2). Because n+2>n and n+2<1000, the induction hypothesis applies and preserves the parity: if n is even (odd) then n+2 is even (odd), whence f(n)=997 (998). Case 2: n ≤ 994. Then n+5<1000, so by the induction hypothesis f(n+5)=997 (if n+5 even) or 998 (if n+5 odd). But n+5 has the opposite parity of n; therefore • if n is even ⇒ n+5 odd ⇒ f(n+5)=998 ⇒ f(n)=f(998)=997, • if n is odd ⇒ n+5 even ⇒ f(n+5)=997 ⇒ f(n)=f(997)=998. Thus the parity rule holds for n, completing the induction. Consequences. For all n<1000, f(n)=997 (n even), f(n)=998 (n odd). Since 84<1000 and 84 is even, f(84)=997. 4. [Conclusion] The required value is f(84)=997.
