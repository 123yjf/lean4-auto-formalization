-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6, and show that the remainder equals 5. 2. [Key Idea] Apply the division algorithm or observe that 1529 is one less than a multiple of 6. 3. [Proof] Direct Calculation • Compute ⌊1529 ÷ 6⌋: 6 × 254 = 1524. • The difference 1529 − 1524 = 5, so 1529 = 6·254 + 5. • Hence 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6). Alternative Observation • 6 divides 1530 (since 1530 = 6·255), and 1529 = 1530 − 1. • Therefore 1529 ≡ −1 ≡ 5 (mod 6). 4. [Conclusion] Both methods confirm that the remainder of 1529 upon division by 6 is 5.
