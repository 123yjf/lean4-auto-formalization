-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the remainder of 5³⁰ upon division by 7. 2. [Key Idea] Fermat’s Little Theorem gives 5⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 7); reducing the exponent 30 modulo 6 settles the question immediately. 3. [Proof] Proof via Fermat’s Little Theorem a. Because 7 is prime and gcd(5, 7)=1, Fermat’s Little Theorem states 5⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 7). b. Write 30 = 6·5, so 5³⁰ = (5⁶)⁵ ≡ 1⁵ = 1 (mod 7). Hence the remainder is 1. Alternate proof by cyclic pattern 5¹ ≡ 5 5² ≡ 4 5³ ≡ 6 5⁴ ≡ 2 5⁵ ≡ 3 5⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 7), and the pattern repeats every 6 powers. Since 30 is a multiple of 6, 5³⁰ falls at the end of a complete cycle: 5³⁰ ≡ 1 (mod 7). 4. [Conclusion] Both methods confirm that 5³⁰ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7.
