-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the sum a + b of the two distinct positive numbers a, b for which each satisfies |x – 1/x| = 1. 2. [Key Idea] The equation x – 1/x = ±1 gives exactly two positive solutions; adding them yields the desired sum. 3. [Proof] Equation set-up For any positive x, “differs from its reciprocal by 1’’ means x – 1/x = 1 or x – 1/x = –1. (1) Solve the two quadratics (i) x – 1/x = 1 ⇒ x² – x – 1 = 0 ⇒ x₁ = (1 + √5)/2. (ii) x – 1/x = –1 ⇒ x² + x – 1 = 0 ⇒ x₂ = (–1 + √5)/2. Both x₁ and x₂ are positive and distinct, so {a, b} = {x₁, x₂}. Sum of the numbers a + b = x₁ + x₂ = (1 + √5)/2 + (–1 + √5)/2 = (2√5)/2 = √5. 4. [Conclusion] The required sum is √5, choice (C).
