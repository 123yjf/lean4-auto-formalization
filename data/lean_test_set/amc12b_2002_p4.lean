-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the unique positive integer n that makes ½ + ⅓ + ⅐ + 1/n an integer and decide which listed divisibility claim fails. 2. [Key Idea] Write the sum over the common denominator 42; the non-n part already equals 41/42, so 1/n must supply the missing 1/42, forcing n = 42. 3. [Proof] Let S = ½ + ⅓ + ⅐ + 1/n = integer. Compute the fixed part: ½ = 21/42, ⅓ = 14/42, ⅐ = 6/42 ⇒ ½ + ⅓ + ⅐ = 41/42. Hence S = 41/42 + 1/n = k ∈ ℤ. Rearrange: 1/n = k − 41/42 = (42k − 41)/42. Because 1/n > 0, we must have k ≥ 1. • If k = 1 → 1/n = (42 – 41)/42 = 1/42 ⇒ n = 42. • If k ≥ 2 → 1/n ≥ (84 – 41)/42 = 43/42 > 1, impossible for positive n. Thus the only solution is n = 42. Check each statement: A. 2 | 42 ( true ) B. 3 | 42 ( true ) C. 6 | 42 ( true ) D. 7 | 42 ( true ) E. n > 84 ( false ) Therefore the statement that is not true is (E) n > 84. 4. [Conclusion] The sum is integral only for n = 42, so every listed divisibility holds except “n > 84,” making option (E) the lone false statement.
