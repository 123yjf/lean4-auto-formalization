-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the coefficient B in z⁶−10z⁵+Az⁴+Bz³+Cz²+Dz+16 when all six roots are (not-necessarily distinct) positive integers. 2. [Key Idea] Viète gives the roots’ sum 10 and product 16; enumerating six positive integers with those two totals leaves exactly one multiset, from which the third elementary symmetric sum (−B) is easy to compute. 3. [Proof] Let the roots be r₁,…,r₆∈ℕ. By Viète: (i) r₁+⋯+r₆ = 10, (ii) r₁r₂⋯r₆ = 16, (iii) the z³–coefficient is (−1)³S₃ = −S₃, so B = −S₃ where S₃ := Σ r_ir_jr_k. Because 16 = 2⁴, every rᵢ is a power of 2. Possible values are 1,2,4 (8 or 16 would exceed the sum 10). Write a = # of 4’s, b = # of 2’s, c = # of 1’s (a+b+c = 6). Product condition: 4ᵃ·2ᵇ = 16 ⇒ 2a + b = 4. Sum condition: 4a + 2b + c = 10 with c = 6−a−b ⇒ 3a + b = 4. Subtracting gives a = 0, hence b = 4, c = 2. Thus the multisets satisfying (i)–(ii) are uniquely {1,1,2,2,2,2}. Compute S₃ (all triple products): • 0 ones: C(4,3)=4 triples, each 8 ⇒ 4·8 = 32 • 1 one : 2·C(4,2)=12 triples, each 4 ⇒ 12·4 = 48 • 2 ones: C(2,2)·4=4 triples, each 2 ⇒ 4·2 = 8 Hence S₃ = 32 + 48 + 8 = 88, so B = –S₃ = –88. 4. [Conclusion] The only possible root multiset forces B = −88, option (A).
