-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine how much water Jasmine will drink in the next 10 miles if her rate is 1.5 pints per 3 miles. 2. [Key Idea] Use a direct proportion: water ∝ distance. 3. [Proof] Method A (Ratio): Water / Distance = 1.5 pints / 3 miles = 0.5 pint per mile. For 10 miles: 0.5 pint × 10 miles = 5 pints. Method B (Scaling the Segment): The segment 10 miles is (10 miles) ÷ (3 miles) = 10⁄3 times the initial 3-mile segment. Water consumed = 1.5 pints × 10⁄3 = (1.5 × 10)⁄3 = 15⁄3 = 5 pints. 4. [Conclusion] Jasmine will drink exactly 5 pints of water during the next 10 miles.
