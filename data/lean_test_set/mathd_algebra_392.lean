-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Three consecutive positive even integers have the sum of their squares equal to 12296; determine their product divided by 8. 2. [Key Idea] Express the numbers as 2k – 2, 2k, 2k + 2, turn the given condition into a quadratic in k, solve for k, then compute the required product. 3. [Proof] Let the three consecutive even numbers be a = 2k – 2, b = 2k, c = 2k + 2 (k ∈ ℕ, k ≥ 2). Sum of squares: (2k – 2)² + (2k)² + (2k + 2)² = 12296 4k² – 8k + 4 + 4k² + 4k² + 8k + 4 = 12296 12k² + 8 = 12296 12k² = 12288 k² = 1024 k = 32 (positive root). Hence a = 2·32 – 2 = 62, b = 64, c = 66. Product divided by 8: (a b c)/8 = (62 × 64 × 66)/8 = 62 × 8 × 66 = 496 × 66 = 32736. 4. [Conclusion] The product of the three numbers divided by 8 equals 32736, as required.
