-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given x² − mx + n = 0 with positive integer roots k > t and prime coefficients m, n, prove that mⁿ + nᵐ + kᵗ + tᵏ = 20. 2. [Key Idea] Because kt is prime, one root must be 1 and the other that prime; demanding k + t also be prime singles out the unique pair (k,t) = (2,1). 3. [Proof] By Vieta: (i) k + t = m (prime) (ii) kt = n (prime) Step 1 – Force one root to be 1. A prime product kt has only the factorizations 1·p or p·1 (p prime). Hence {k,t} = {p,1} with p := n prime, giving t = 1, k = p. Step 2 – Impose that k + t is prime. m = k + t = p + 1 must be prime. For a prime p, p + 1 is prime only when p = 2 (since every other prime is odd and adding 1 makes it even > 2). Thus k = 2, t = 1, n = 2, m = 3. Step 3 – Evaluate the required sum. mⁿ + nᵐ + kᵗ + tᵏ = 3² + 2³ + 2¹ + 1² = 9 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 20. 4. [Conclusion] The only possible roots are k = 2, t = 1, yielding mⁿ + nᵐ + kᵗ + tᵏ = 20.
