-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine last year’s enrollment if this year’s 598 students represent a 4 % increase. 2. [Key Idea] “598 students” equals 104 % of last year’s total, so divide by 1.04 (or set up a proportion). 3. [Proof] Algebraic method Let x = last year’s enrollment. Given 598 = 1.04 x, hence x = 598 / 1.04 = 575. Therefore last year there were 575 students. Proportional method A 4 % increase means the ratio new / old = 104 % / 100 % = 26 / 25. So (new)/(old) = 26/25 ⇒ old = (25/26)·598 = 575. 4. [Conclusion] Last year Liberty Middle School enrolled 575 students.
