-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the smallest possible value of m + n given gcd(m, n) = 6 and lcm(m, n) = 126. 2. [Key Idea] Factor out the gcd: write m = 6a, n = 6b; then a and b are coprime and their lcm equals 21, so ab = 21. Minimize a + b, then scale back by 6. 3. [Proof] Let m = 6a, n = 6b with gcd(a, b) = 1. Because lcm(m, n) = 6ab = 126, we get ab = 126 / 6 = 21. (1) Since gcd(a, b) = 1, the only coprime factor pairs of 21 are (1, 21) and (3, 7). Compute a + b for each pair: • (a, b) = (1, 21) → a + b = 22. • (a, b) = (3, 7) → a + b = 10. The smaller sum is 10, achieved by (a, b) = (3, 7). Thus m + n = 6(a + b) = 6 · 10 = 60. No other coprime pair of positive integers multiplies to 21, so 60 is the minimal possible value. 4. [Conclusion] The least possible value of m + n under the given conditions is 60.
