-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given a positive real number a with 2 < a² < 3 and ⟨a⁻¹⟩ = ⟨a²⟩, show that a¹² – 144 a⁻¹ = 233. 2. [Key Idea] Because 2 < a² < 3, the two fractional–part conditions reduce to a⁻¹ = a² – 2, giving the cubic a³ – 2a – 1 = 0; its only positive root is the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2, whose powers are governed by Fibonacci numbers. 3. [Proof] Step 1. Equal fractional parts. Since 2 < a² < 3, ⟨a²⟩ = a² – 2. Because 1/√3 < a⁻¹ < 1, ⟨a⁻¹⟩ = a⁻¹. Thus a⁻¹ = a² – 2 ⇒ a³ – 2a – 1 = 0. (1) Step 2. Solving the cubic. Equation (1) factors as (a + 1)(a² – a – 1) = 0. The only positive root is a = φ := (1 + √5)/2. Check: φ² = φ + 1 ≈ 2.618, satisfying 2 < a² < 3. Step 3. φ-powers via Fibonacci numbers. For all n ≥ 0, φⁿ = Fₙ φ + Fₙ₋₁, where F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1. With F₁₂ = 144 and F₁₁ = 89, φ¹² = 144 φ + 89. (2) Step 4. Compute a¹² – 144 a⁻¹. Note φ⁻¹ = φ – 1. Using (2): a¹² – 144 a⁻¹ = (144 φ + 89) – 144(φ – 1) = 144 φ + 89 – 144 φ + 144 = 233. 4. [Conclusion] Therefore the required value is a¹² – 144 a⁻¹ = 233.
