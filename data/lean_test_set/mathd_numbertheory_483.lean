-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that the 100-th Fibonacci number leaves remainder 3 when divided by 4. 2. [Key Idea] Because every Fibonacci number is defined from the two preceding ones, the sequence taken modulo 4 must eventually repeat; in fact, modulo 4 the Fibonacci sequence has period 6, so F₁₀₀ (mod 4) equals F₄ (mod 4). 3. [Proof] Let F₁=F₂=1 and F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_n. Work throughout modulo 4. Step 1: Find the period modulo 4. Compute the first terms mod 4: F₁ ≡1, F₂ ≡1 F₃ ≡2, F₄ ≡3, F₅ ≡1, F₆ ≡0 F₇ ≡1, F₈ ≡1 … The pair (F₇,F₈) reproduces the starting pair (1,1), so the sequence repeats every 6 terms. Therefore the Pisano period for modulus 4 is 6: (F_{n+6} ≡ F_n (mod 4) for all n). Step 2: Reduce the index 100 modulo the period 6. 100 ≡ 4 (mod 6), hence F₁₀₀ ≡ F₄ (mod 4). Step 3: Read off F₄ mod 4. From the list above, F₄ ≡ 3 (mod 4). Therefore F₁₀₀ ≡ 3 (mod 4). 4. [Conclusion] The 100-th Fibonacci number leaves remainder 3 upon division by 4.
