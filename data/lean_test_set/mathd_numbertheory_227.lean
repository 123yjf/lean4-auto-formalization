-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given that every family member drank an 8-ounce coffee–milk mixture, Angela’s cup contained ¼ of all the milk and ⅙ of all the coffee; determine the family size. 2. [Key Idea] Translate the verbal conditions into two linear equations for the total milk M, total coffee C, and the number n of 8-ounce cups; positivity of M and C then pins down the unique integer n. 3. [Proof] Let n = number of family members (cups), M = total ounces of milk consumed, C = total ounces of coffee consumed. (a) Total volume: M + C = 8n. (1) (b) Angela’s cup: (¼)M + (⅙)C = 8. (2) Multiply (2) by 12 to clear denominators: 3M + 2C = 96. (3) Solve the pair (1)–(3): From (1): C = 8n – M. Insert in (3): 3M + 2(8n – M) = 96 ⇒ 3M + 16n – 2M = 96 ⇒ M + 16n = 96 ⇒ M = 96 – 16n. (4) Then C = 8n – M = 8n – (96 – 16n) = 24n – 96. (5) Milk and coffee were “never zero”, so M > 0 and C > 0. M > 0 ⇒ 96 – 16n > 0 ⇒ n < 6 C > 0 ⇒ 24n – 96 > 0 ⇒ n > 4 The only integer n satisfying 4 < n < 6 is n = 5. 4. [Conclusion] Exactly five family members drank the coffee–milk mixtures.
