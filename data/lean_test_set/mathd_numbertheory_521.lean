-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the larger of two consecutive positive even integers whose product equals 288. 2. [Key Idea] Write the integers as 2n and 2n + 2, convert the product condition to a quadratic in n, and solve. 3. [Proof] Let the consecutive even integers be 2n and 2n + 2 (n ∈ ℕ). Product condition: 2n(2n + 2)=288 ⇒ 4n(n+1)=288 ⇒ n(n+1)=72. Form the quadratic: n²+n−72=0. Factorisation method: (n+9)(n−8)=0 ⟹ n=8 (positive root). Hence the integers are 2n=2·8=16 and 2n + 2=18. Alternate (quadratic-formula) method: n=[−1±√(1+288)]/2=[−1±17]/2 → n=8 (discard n=−9). 4. [Conclusion] The greater of the two consecutive positive even integers is 18.
