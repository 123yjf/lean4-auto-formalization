-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given s₁ = ax + by = 3, s₂ = ax² + by² = 7, s₃ = ax³ + by³ = 16, s₄ = ax⁴ + by⁴ = 42, find s₅ = ax⁵ + by⁵. 2. [Key Idea] Because sₙ = axⁿ + byⁿ comes from two bases x, y, the sequence (sₙ) satisfies the second-order linear recurrence sₙ = p sₙ₋₁ – q sₙ₋₂ with p = x + y and q = xy; p and q are obtained from the given four values, then s₅ follows immediately. 3. [Proof] Let sₙ = axⁿ + byⁿ (n ≥ 1). Since (t – x)(t – y) = t² – p t + q with p = x + y and q = xy, we have for every n ≥ 3 sₙ = p sₙ₋₁ – q sₙ₋₂. (♠) Use n = 3 and n = 4 to obtain p and q. (i) For n = 3: 16 = p·7 – q·3 ⇒ 7p – 3q = 16. (1) (ii) For n = 4: 42 = p·16 – q·7 ⇒ 16p – 7q = 42. (2) Solve (1), (2): Multiply (1) by 7: 49p – 21q = 112 Multiply (2) by 3: 48p – 21q = 126 Subtract: p = –14. Back to (1): 7(–14) – 3q = 16 ⇒ –98 – 3q = 16 ⇒ q = –38. Now apply (♠) with n = 5: s₅ = p s₄ – q s₃ = (–14)(42) – (–38)(16) = –588 + 608 = 20. Hence ax⁵ + by⁵ = 20. (Alternative one-line check: once p and q are known, the characteristic polynomial t² + 14t – 38 annihilates the sequence; computing modulo this polynomial immediately gives the same value.) 4. [Conclusion] The required value is s₅ = ax⁵ + by⁵ = 20 (i.e., 020 as stated).
