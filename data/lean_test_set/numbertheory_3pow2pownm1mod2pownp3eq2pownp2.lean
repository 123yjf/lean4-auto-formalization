-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that for every positive integer n, 3^{2^{n}} − 1 leaves the remainder 2^{\,n+2} upon division by 2^{\,n+3}. 2. [Key Idea] Apply the 2–adic valuation version of the Lifting-the-Exponent (LTE) lemma to determine v₂(3^{2^{n}}−1); once this highest power of 2 is known, the required remainder follows immediately. 3. [Proof] Let v₂(x) denote the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing x. Step 1 – Evaluate v₂(3^{2^{n}}−1) with LTE. For odd integers a,b and even m, LTE states v₂(a^{m}-b^{m}) = v₂(a-b) + v₂(a+b) + v₂(m) − 1. Choose a = 3, b = 1, m = 2^{n} (even). Then v₂(3^{2^{n}}−1) = v₂(3−1) + v₂(3+1) + v₂(2^{n}) − 1 = v₂(2) + v₂(4) + n − 1 = 1 + 2 + n − 1 = n + 2. Thus 2^{\,n+2} ∣ (3^{2^{n}}−1) but 2^{\,n+3} ∤ (3^{2^{n}}−1). Step 2 – Convert the valuation result into the requested congruence. Write 3^{2^{n}}−1 = 2^{\,n+2}·k with k odd (because an extra factor 2 would contradict v₂ = n+2). Modulo 2^{\,n+3} we have 3^{2^{n}}−1 ≡ 2^{\,n+2}·k ≡ 2^{\,n+2}·(k mod 2). Since k is odd, k mod 2 = 1, giving 3^{2^{n}}−1 ≡ 2^{\,n+2} (mod 2^{\,n+3}). 4. [Conclusion] The highest power of 2 dividing 3^{2^{n}}−1 is exactly 2^{\,n+2}, hence its remainder modulo 2^{\,n+3} is 2^{\,n+2}.
