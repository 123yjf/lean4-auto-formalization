-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that for all real numbers a, b, |a+b| /(1+|a+b|) ≤ |a| /(1+|a|) + |b| /(1+|b|). 2. [Key Idea] Write x = |a| ≥ 0 and y = |b| ≥ 0, set g(t) = t /(1+t) (t ≥ 0), and show directly that g is sub-additive: g(x)+g(y) − g(x+y) ≥ 0. 3. [Proof] Let x = |a|, y = |b| (hence x,y ≥ 0). Define g(t) = t /(1+t), t ≥ 0. We must establish g(x)+g(y) ≥ g(x+y). Compute the difference Δ = g(x)+g(y) − g(x+y) = x/(1+x) + y/(1+y) − (x+y)/(1+x+y). Put everything over the common denominator (1+x)(1+y)(1+x+y): Δ = [x(1+y)(1+x+y) + y(1+x)(1+x+y) − (x+y)(1+x)(1+y)] /[(1+x)(1+y)(1+x+y)]. Expanding the numerators and simplifying gives x(1+y)(1+x+y) + y(1+x)(1+x+y) − (x+y)(1+x)(1+y) = xy(2+x+y) ≥ 0. Because the denominator (1+x)(1+y)(1+x+y) is positive, we have Δ ≥ 0, i.e. g(x)+g(y) ≥ g(x+y). Substituting back x = |a|, y = |b| yields the desired inequality. (Alternate proof sketch) Since g''(t)= −2/(1+t)³<0, g is concave on [0,∞). For concave, increasing g we know g(x+y) ≤ g(x)+g(y) (verified by the preceding algebra, confirming sub-additivity). 4. [Conclusion] Thus for all real a, b the inequality |a+b| /(1+|a+b|) ≤ |a| /(1+|a|) + |b| /(1+|b|) holds.
