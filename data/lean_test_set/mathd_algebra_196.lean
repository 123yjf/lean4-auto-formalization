-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the sum of all real numbers x that satisfy |2 − x| = 3. 2. [Key Idea] The absolute–value equation |A| = k, with k > 0, is equivalent to A = k or A = −k; solving both and adding the roots gives the desired sum. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (Direct): |2 − x| = 3 ⇒ 2 − x = 3 or 2 − x = −3 • 2 − x = 3 ⇒ x = −1 • 2 − x = −3 ⇒ x = 5 Sum of solutions: (−1) + 5 = 4. Method 2 (Symmetry): The graph of y = |2 − x| is a V-shape symmetric about x = 2. The horizontal line y = 3 cuts this V at two symmetric points, equally distant from x = 2. Hence if one solution is 2 − 3 = −1, the other is 2 + 3 = 5; their sum is (2 − 3)+(2 + 3)=4. 4. [Conclusion] The sum of all real solutions to |2 − x| = 3 is 4.
