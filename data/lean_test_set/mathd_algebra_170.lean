-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Count the integers x that satisfy |x − 2| ≤ 5.6. 2. [Key Idea] Translate the absolute-value inequality into a closed interval and count the integers lying in that interval. 3. [Proof] |x − 2| ≤ 5.6 ⇔ −5.6 ≤ x − 2 ≤ 5.6 Adding 2 throughout: −3.6 ≤ x ≤ 7.6. The integers in [−3.6, 7.6] are −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. There are 11 such integers. (Alternate counting via floor/ceiling) Smallest integer ≥ −3.6 is ⌈−3.6⌉ = −3. Largest integer ≤ 7.6 is ⌊7.6⌋ = 7. Number of integers = 7 − (−3) + 1 = 11. 4. [Conclusion] Exactly 11 integers satisfy |x − 2| ≤ 5.6.
