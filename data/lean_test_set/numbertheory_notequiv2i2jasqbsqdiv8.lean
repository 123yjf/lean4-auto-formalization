-- [Problem Restatement] Prove that “a and b are both even iff 8 | (a²+b²)” is not true for all integers a,b. [Key Idea] A square modulo 8 is always 0, 1 or 4; checking these residues shows 8 | (a²+b²) forces evenness, but evenness alone does not guarantee divisibility by 8. [Proof] 1. Possible square residues mod 8 For any integer n we have n ≡ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (mod 8) ⇒ n² ≡ 0,1,4,1,0,1,4,1 (mod 8). Hence n² ≡ 0 or 4 if n is even, and n² ≡ 1 if n is odd. 2. The ⇒ (forward) direction is false Take a = 2, b = 0 (both even). a² + b² = 4 + 0 = 4, and 4 is not divisible by 8. Thus “both even ⇒ 8 | (a²+b²)” fails. 3. The ⇐ (converse) direction is true Suppose 8 | (a²+b²). Reduce modulo 8: a² + b² ≡ 0 (mod 8). If a were odd, a² ≡ 1, so b² would have to satisfy b² ≡ 7 (impossible). Therefore a is even, and the same argument forces b even. Hence 8 | (a²+b²) ⇒ a,b even. 4. Alternative succinct counterexample-only proof One counterexample (a,b) = (2,0) already invalidates the biconditional. [Conclusion] Because the forward implication fails (e.g. 2²+0² = 4), the statement “a and b are both even iff 8 divides a²+b²” is false.
