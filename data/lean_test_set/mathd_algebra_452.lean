-- 1. [Problem Restatement] In an arithmetic sequence with first term 2/3 and ninth term 4/5, find the fifth term. 2. [Key Idea] Use the linear formula an = a1 + (n−1)d; once d is determined from the first and ninth terms, plug n = 5. 3. [Proof] Let a1 = 2/3 and common difference d. The ninth term is a9 = a1 + 8d = 4/5 ⇒ 8d = 4/5 − 2/3 = 12/15 − 10/15 = 2/15 ⇒ d = (2/15)/8 = 1/60. The fifth term is a5 = a1 + 4d = 2/3 + 4(1/60) = 2/3 + 1/15 = 10/15 + 1/15 = 11/15. (Alternative view: the fifth term is exactly halfway between the first and ninth terms, so a5 = (a1 + a9)/2 = (2/3 + 4/5)/2 = (10/15 + 12/15)/2 = 22/15 ÷ 2 = 11/15.) 4. [Conclusion] The fifth term of the sequence is indeed 11/15.
