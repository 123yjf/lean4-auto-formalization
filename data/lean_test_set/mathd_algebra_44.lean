-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the unique pair (s, t) that satisfies the simultaneous equations s = 9 − 2t and t = 3s + 1. 2. [Key Idea] Substitute one equation into the other to reduce the system to a single linear equation, then back-substitute. 3. [Proof] Start with s = 9 − 2t. Insert this expression for s into t = 3s + 1: t = 3(9 − 2t) + 1 t = 27 − 6t + 1 t = 28 − 6t 7t = 28 t = 4. Substitute t = 4 back into s = 9 − 2t: s = 9 − 2(4) s = 9 − 8 s = 1. Hence the intersection point is (s, t) = (1, 4). 4. [Conclusion] The two lines intersect exactly at (1, 4).
