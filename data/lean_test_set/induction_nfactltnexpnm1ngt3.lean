-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that every integer n ≥ 3 satisfies n! < n^{\,n-1}. 2. [Key Idea] Induct on n, using the decomposition n! = n·(n-1)! and the obvious fact that replacing the base n-1 by the larger base n enlarges any positive power. 3. [Proof] Induction proof (i) Base case n = 3: 3! = 6 < 9 = 3^{2}. (ii) Induction step: Assume for some k ≥ 3 that k! < k^{\,k-1}. For n = k+1 we have (k+1)! = (k+1)·k! < (k+1)·k^{\,k-1} (by the induction hypothesis) ≤ (k+1)·(k+1)^{\,k-1} (since k < k+1) = (k+1)^{\,k}. Thus (k+1)! < (k+1)^{\,k}, completing the induction. 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, for every integer n ≥ 3, the factorial n! is strictly smaller than n^{\,n-1}.
