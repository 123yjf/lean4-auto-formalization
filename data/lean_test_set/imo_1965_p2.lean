-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that a real 3×3 homogeneous linear system whose matrix A has positive diagonal entries, negative off–diagonals, and positive row–sums admits only the trivial solution. 2. [Key Idea] Because every row satisfies a_ii > −∑_{j≠i}a_ij = ∑_{j≠i}|a_ij|, the matrix is strictly diagonally dominant; the Levy–Desplanques (or Gershgorin-circle) theorem then guarantees A is nonsingular. 3. [Proof] First proof (Levy–Desplanques). For row i a_ii + Σ_{j≠i} a_ij > 0 (by assumption (c)), but a_ij < 0 for j ≠ i, so a_ii > −Σ_{j≠i} a_ij = Σ_{j≠i} |a_ij|. (1) Inequality (1) is the strict diagonal dominance condition. Levy–Desplanques: A strictly diagonally dominant square matrix is nonsingular. Hence det A ≠ 0, and the only solution to A x = 0 is x = 0. Second proof (direct, without determinants). Assume A x = 0 with x ≠ 0 and pick k such that |x_k| = max_i |x_i|. Let s = sign(x_k) (s = ±1). Multiply the k-th equation by s: 0 = a_kk|x_k| + Σ_{j≠k} a_kj s x_j ≥ a_kk|x_k| − Σ_{j≠k} |a_kj||x_j| (because a_kj < 0 and |x_j| ≤ |x_k|) ≥ (a_kk − Σ_{j≠k} |a_kj|)|x_k| > 0 (by (1)), a contradiction. Therefore x must be the zero vector. 4. [Conclusion] The coefficient matrix is nonsingular, so the homogeneous system admits only the trivial solution x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = 0.
