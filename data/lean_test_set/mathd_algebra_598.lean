-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Compute the product a b c d when 4ᵃ = 5, 5ᵇ = 6, 6ᶜ = 7, and 7ᵈ = 8. 2. [Key Idea] Rewrite each exponent as a logarithm and notice that consecutive bases cancel: log₄5·log₅6·log₆7·log₇8 = log₄8. 3. [Proof] Let a = log₄5, b = log₅6, c = log₆7, d = log₇8. Then a b c d = (log₄5)(log₅6)(log₆7)(log₇8). Step-by-step cancellation using logₓy·log_yz = logₓz: • (log₄5)(log₅6) = log₄6. • log₄6·log₆7 = log₄7. • log₄7·log₇8 = log₄8. Now evaluate log₄8: 4 = 2², 8 = 2³ ⇒ log₄8 = (log₂8)/(log₂4) = 3/2. Hence a b c d = 3/2. (Alternative style) Direct change of base: a b c d = ln5/ln4 · ln6/ln5 · ln7/ln6 · ln8/ln7 = ln8/ln4 = ln2³/ln2² = 3/2. 4. [Conclusion] The product a·b·c·d equals 3/2.
