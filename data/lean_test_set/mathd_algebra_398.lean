-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Convert 80 lugs into ligs given that 7 ligs = 4 lags and 9 lags = 20 lugs. 2. [Key Idea] Link the three units through fraction-form conversion factors and cancel sequentially. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (factor chain). 80 lugs × (9 lags / 20 lugs) × (7 ligs / 4 lags) = 80·9·7 / (20·4) ligs = 80/20·9/4·7 ligs = 4·(9/4)·7 ligs = 9·7 ligs = 63 ligs. Method 2 (proportions). Step 1: 9 lags = 20 lugs → 80 lugs corresponds to (80·9)/20 = 36 lags. Step 2: 7 ligs = 4 lags → 36 lags corresponds to (36·7)/4 = 63 ligs. 4. [Conclusion] Hence 80 lugs are exactly equivalent to 63 ligs.
