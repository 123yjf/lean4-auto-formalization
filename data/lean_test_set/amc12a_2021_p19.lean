-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Count the x ∈ [0, π] which satisfy sin( (π/2) cos x ) = cos( (π/2) sin x ). 2. [Key Idea] Rewrite the cosine term as a sine, observe both sine-arguments lie in the monotone interval [–π/2, π/2], so equality of the sines forces the arguments themselves to coincide, reducing the task to solving sin x + cos x = 1. 3. [Proof] Step 1. Put everything in terms of sine. cos( (π/2) sin x ) = sin( π/2 – (π/2) sin x ) = sin( (π/2)(1 – sin x) ). The equation becomes sin( (π/2) cos x ) = sin( (π/2)(1 – sin x) ). (1) Step 2. Locate the two arguments. For x ∈ [0, π] A(x) = (π/2) cos x ∈ [–π/2, π/2], B(x) = (π/2)(1 – sin x) ∈ [0, π/2]. Since sin θ is strictly increasing on [–π/2, π/2], equality of the sines in (1) is possible only when the arguments themselves are equal; the alternatives A = π – B or A = –π – B lie outside the above ranges. Thus we must have (π/2) cos x = (π/2)(1 – sin x), i.e. cos x + sin x = 1. (2) Step 3. Solve (2). Write sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x + π/4); then (2) gives √2 sin(x + π/4) = 1 ⇒ sin(x + π/4) = 1/√2 = sin(π/4). Hence x + π/4 = π/4 + 2kπ or x + π/4 = 3π/4 + 2kπ. Therefore x = 0 + 2kπ or x = π/2 + 2kπ. Restricting to [0, π] leaves the two solutions x = 0, x = π/2. Both satisfy the original equation: • x = 0: sin(π/2 · 1) = 1, cos(π/2 · 0) = 1. • x = π/2: sin(π/2 · 0) = 0, cos(π/2 · 1) = 0. 4. [Conclusion] Exactly two points, x = 0 and x = π/2, solve the equation on [0, π]; choice (C) 2.
