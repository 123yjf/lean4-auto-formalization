-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the real number x that minimizes f(x)=x²−14x+3 and verify that this minimizer is x=7. 2. [Key Idea] A quadratic ax²+bx+c (a>0) attains its minimum at the vertex x = −b/(2a); equivalently, completing the square isolates a perfect square that is ≥0. 3. [Proof] Method A – Vertex formula a) Here a=1, b=−14. b) Vertex: x = −b/(2a) = −(−14)/(2·1) = 7. c) Because a=1>0, the parabola opens upward, so x=7 gives the unique minimum. Method B – Completing the square x²−14x+3 = (x²−14x+49) −49 +3 = (x−7)² −46. Since (x−7)² ≥ 0 for all x, the expression is minimized when (x−7)² = 0, i.e., at x = 7. 4. [Conclusion] Both approaches confirm that the quadratic attains its minimum precisely at x = 7.
