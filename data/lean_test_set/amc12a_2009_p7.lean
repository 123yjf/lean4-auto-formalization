-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the index n for which the arithmetic progression whose first three terms are 2x – 3, 5x – 11, 3x + 1 equals 2009 at its n-th term. 2. [Key Idea] In an arithmetic sequence consecutive differences are equal; solving for x fixes the entire sequence, after which the general term can be set to 2009 to obtain n. 3. [Proof] Let the first three terms be a₁ = 2x − 3, a₂ = 5x − 11, a₃ = 3x + 1. Equal differences: a₂ − a₁ = a₃ − a₂ (5x − 11) − (2x − 3) = (3x + 1) − (5x − 11) 3x − 8 = −2x + 12 5x = 20 ⇒ x = 4. Hence a₁ = 2(4) − 3 = 5, common difference d = a₂ − a₁ = 3(4) − 8 = 4. General term: a_n = a₁ + (n − 1)d = 5 + 4(n − 1) = 4n + 1. Set equal to 2009: 4n + 1 = 2009 ⇒ 4n = 2008 ⇒ n = 502. 4. [Conclusion] The n-th term equal to 2009 occurs at n = 502.
