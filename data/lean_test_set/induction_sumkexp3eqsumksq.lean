-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For every natural number n, prove 0³+1³+⋯+(n−1)³ equals (0+1+⋯+(n−1))². 2. [Key Idea] Induction shows that adding the next cube increases the square of the triangular number by exactly that cube; equivalently, one checks (n(n+1)/2)²−(n(n−1)/2)²=n³. 3. [Proof] Induction proof. Base step (n=1): both sides are 0, so the statement is true. Inductive step: Assume Σ_{k=0}^{n−1} k³ = ( Σ_{k=0}^{n−1} k )² = ( n(n−1)/2 )². Add n³ to both sides: Σ_{k=0}^{n} k³ = ( n(n−1)/2 )² + n³. Compute how much the square of the triangular number grows when n is increased by 1: ( n(n+1)/2 )² − ( n(n−1)/2 )² = n²/4 [ (n+1)² − (n−1)² ] = n²/4 [ n²+2n+1 − (n²−2n+1) ] = n²/4 · 4n = n³. Thus ( n(n−1)/2 )² + n³ = ( n(n+1)/2 )², which matches the left–hand side. The statement therefore holds for n+1, completing the induction. (Alternative: Telescoping) Sum (k+1)⁴−k⁴=4k³+6k²+4k+1 from k=0 to n−1 to obtain n⁴ = 4Σk³ + 6Σk² + 4Σk + n. Using the well-known formulas for Σk and Σk² and solving for Σk³ gives Σk³ = (Σk)², the desired identity. 4. [Conclusion] Hence, for every natural number n, the sum of the first n cubes equals the square of the sum of the first n integers.
