-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the product P = 1·3·5·…·9999 and show it equals 10000! ⁄ (2^5000·5000!). 2. [Key Idea] Factor 10000! into even and odd parts; each even factor contributes a 2, leaving a 1–5000 factorial for the remaining halves. 3. [Proof] Let P = ∏_{k=1}^{5000} (2k – 1). 10000! = ∏_{m=1}^{10000} m = ∏_{k=1}^{5000} (2k – 1)(2k) (split into odd and even terms) = P · ∏_{k=1}^{5000} 2k = P · 2^{5000} · (1·2·…·5000) = P · 2^{5000} · 5000!. Hence P = 10000! / (2^{5000}·5000!). (Alternate view: (2n)! / (2^n n!) = 1·3·…·(2n–1); setting n = 5000 gives the same result.) 4. [Conclusion] The product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is choice (D): 10000! ⁄ (2^{5000}·5000!).
