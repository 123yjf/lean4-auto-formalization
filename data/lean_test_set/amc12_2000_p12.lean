-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given non-negative integers A, M, C with A+M+C = 12, find the maximum of P = AMC + AM + AC + MC. 2. [Key Idea] Factor P to (A+1)(M+1)(C+1) − 13; hence maximize the product of three positive integers whose sum is fixed (15), which is greatest when they are as equal as possible. 3. [Proof] Factorisation step P = AMC + AM + AC + MC = (A+1)(M+1)(C+1) − (A+M+C) − 1 = (A+1)(M+1)(C+1) − 13. (1) Set x = A+1, y = M+1, z = C+1. Then x, y, z are positive integers with x + y + z = 15. Equation (1) becomes P = xyz − 13. Maximising xyz under x+y+z = 15 By the Arithmetic–Geometric Mean inequality, xyz ≤ ( (x+y+z)/3 )³ = 5³ = 125, with equality when x = y = z = 5. Integers 5, 5, 5 indeed sum to 15, so this maximum is attainable at x = y = z = 5 ⇒ A = M = C = 4. Thus P_max = 125 − 13 = 112. Alternative quick check Any deviation from 5,5,5 lowers the product: e.g. (6,5,4) gives 120 < 125, etc., so 112 is the unique maximum value. 4. [Conclusion] The greatest possible value of AMC + AM + AC + MC is 112, corresponding to choice (E).
