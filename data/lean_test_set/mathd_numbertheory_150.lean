-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the least positive integer N for which 7 + 30N is composite; prove it is N = 6. 2. [Key Idea] Work modulo 11: 7 + 30N is divisible by 11 exactly when N ≡ 6 (mod 11); the first such N is 6, and direct inspection shows the five smaller values of N still give primes. 3. [Proof] Mod-11 argument a) Reduce the coefficient of N: 30 ≡ 8 (mod 11). b) Set 7 + 30N ≡ 0 (mod 11): 7 + 8N ≡ 0 ⇒ 8N ≡ 4 (mod 11). c) Multiply by the inverse of 8 modulo 11 (8·7 ≡ 1): N ≡ 4·7 ≡ 28 ≡ 6 (mod 11). Thus every number of the form N = 11k + 6 (k ≥ 0) makes 7 + 30N a multiple of 11 and hence composite. Smallest such N Take k = 0 → N = 6. 7 + 30·6 = 7 + 180 = 187 = 11·17, clearly not prime. Primality for N = 1,…,5 Direct checks (all below the square root bound 13 suffice): N = 1 → 37 (prime) N = 2 → 67 (prime) N = 3 → 97 (prime) N = 4 → 127 (prime) N = 5 → 157 (prime) Since N = 1–5 give primes and N = 6 already yields a factor of 11, the minimal positive N making 7 + 30N composite is 6. (Alternative brute-force proof: compute the same six values and observe only the last is composite.) 4. [Conclusion] The smallest positive integer that makes 7 + 30N non-prime is N = 6.
