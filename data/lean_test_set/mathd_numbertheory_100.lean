-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the integer n such that gcd(n, 40) = 10 and lcm(n, 40) = 280. 2. [Key Idea] For any positive integers a and b, a·b = gcd(a, b) · lcm(a, b). 3. [Proof] Direct computation a) Use the product formula: n·40 = gcd(n, 40) · lcm(n, 40) = 10 · 280. b) Solve for n: n = (10 · 280) / 40 = 280 / 4 = 70. Verification gcd(70, 40) = 10 (common factors 2 and 5 only) lcm(70, 40) = (70·40)/10 = 280. Both required conditions are met. Alternative style (prime–factor check) 40 = 2³·5, 70 = 2·5·7. gcd: min powers → 2¹·5¹ = 10. lcm: max powers → 2³·5¹·7¹ = 280. 4. [Conclusion] The unique integer satisfying the given gcd and lcm conditions is n = 70.
