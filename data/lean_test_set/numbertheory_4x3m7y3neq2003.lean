-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that the Diophantine equation 4x³ − 7y³ = 2003 has no integer solutions. 2. [Key Idea] Work modulo 7: the term 7y³ vanishes, while 4x³ must equal 1 (mod 7); but 1/4 (mod 7) is 2, and 2 is not a cubic residue modulo 7. 3. [Proof] Assume, for contradiction, that integers x, y satisfy 4x³ − 7y³ = 2003. Step 1. Reduce the equation modulo 7. Because 7y³ ≡ 0 (mod 7), we obtain 4x³ ≡ 2003 (mod 7). Step 2. Simplify the right–hand side. 2003 ÷ 7 = 286 remainder 1, so 4x³ ≡ 1 (mod 7). Step 3. Isolate x³. The multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 7 is 2 (since 4·2 ≡ 1), hence x³ ≡ 2 (mod 7). Step 4. List all cubic residues modulo 7. 0³ ≡ 0, 1³ ≡ 1, 2³ ≡ 1, 3³ ≡ 6, 4³ ≡ 1, 5³ ≡ 6, 6³ ≡ 6 (mod 7). Thus the only possible values of a cube mod 7 are 0, 1, 6. Step 5. Contradiction. 2 is not among {0, 1, 6}, contradicting x³ ≡ 2 (mod 7). Therefore no such integers x and y exist. 4. [Conclusion] Because the assumed congruence cannot occur modulo 7, the equation 4x³ − 7y³ = 2003 has no integer solutions.
