-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given x = r^{1/3} with x + 1/x = 3, prove that r³ + 1/r³ = 5778. 2. [Key Idea] Translate the statement into powers of x, repeatedly use the identities (x + 1/x)² = x² + 1/x² + 2 and (x + 1/x)³ = x³ + 1/x³ + 3(x + 1/x), then apply the same cubic-expansion once more to reach the ninth powers. 3. [Proof] Let x = r^{1/3} (so r = x³). Step 1: First and third powers. Given x + 1/x = 3. Hence x³ + 1/x³ = (x + 1/x)³ – 3(x + 1/x) = 3³ – 3·3 = 27 – 9 = 18. (1) Step 2: Ninth powers. Apply the same expansion to x³ + 1/x³: (x³ + 1/x³)³ = x⁹ + 1/x⁹ + 3(x³ + 1/x³). Using (1): 18³ = x⁹ + 1/x⁹ + 3·18 ⟹ 5832 = x⁹ + 1/x⁹ + 54 ⟹ x⁹ + 1/x⁹ = 5832 – 54 = 5778. (2) Step 3: Translate back to r. Because r³ = x⁹ and 1/r³ = 1/x⁹, equation (2) is exactly r³ + 1/r³ = 5778. 4. [Conclusion] Starting from x + 1/x = 3, repeated cubic expansions yield r³ + 1/r³ = 5778.
