-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the value n for which a point in the third quadrant that is 6 units below the x-axis and 15 units from (8, 3) is √n units from the origin. 2. [Key Idea] Because the point is 6 units from the x-axis and lies below it, its y-coordinate is −6; substituting this into the distance-from-(8, 3) equation yields its x-coordinate, after which the distance to the origin gives n. 3. [Proof] Let the point be (x, y) with x<0 and y<0. Step 1. Distance from the x-axis: |y| = 6 ⇒ y = −6. Step 2. Distance from (8, 3): (x − 8)² + (y − 3)² = 15² (x − 8)² + (−6 − 3)² = 225 (x − 8)² + (−9)² = 225 (x − 8)² + 81 = 225 (x − 8)² = 144 x − 8 = ±12 ⇒ x = 20 or x = −4. Since the point is in the third quadrant, x<0, so x = −4. Step 3. Distance from the origin: (x, y) = (−4, −6) Distance² = (−4)² + (−6)² = 16 + 36 = 52 Hence the distance is √52, so n = 52. 4. [Conclusion] The required value is n = 52.
