-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the minimum possible value of lcm(a,b) when a,b are positive integers ending in 2 and 4 respectively and gcd(a,b)=6. 2. [Key Idea] Factor out the forced gcd: write a=6x, b=6y with gcd(x,y)=1; then minimise the product xy subject to the last–digit conditions inherited from a and b. 3. [Proof] Step 1. Strip off the gcd. Because gcd(a,b)=6, set a = 6x , b = 6y with gcd(x,y)=1. Step 2. Translate the last–digit conditions. a ends in 2 ⇒ 6x ≡ 2 (mod 10). Dividing by 2 gives 3x ≡ 1 (mod 5) ⇒ x ≡ 2 (mod 5). b ends in 4 ⇒ 6y ≡ 4 (mod 10). Dividing by 2 gives 3y ≡ 2 (mod 5) ⇒ y ≡ 4 (mod 5). Thus x ≡ 2 (mod 5) and y ≡ 4 (mod 5). Step 3. Minimise xy under these congruences and gcd(x,y)=1. Smallest admissible x-values: 2,7,12,… Smallest admissible y-values: 4,9,14,… • (x,y)=(2,4) is forbidden because gcd(2,4)=2 ≠1. • Next pair (2,9): gcd(2,9)=1 and product xy=18. Any other permitted pair has at least one coordinate ≥7, giving xy ≥ 7·4 =28 > 18. Hence the minimum possible product is xy=18. Step 4. Compute the least common multiple. lcm(a,b)= a·b / gcd(a,b) = 6x·6y / 6 = 6xy. With xy=18 we obtain lcm(a,b)=6·18 = 108. 4. [Conclusion] The smallest possible least common multiple of a and b is 108.
