-- 1. [Problem Restatement] How many perfect‐square divisors does the integer 1!·2!·3!·…·9! possess? 2. [Key Idea] Write the product as ∏_{t=1}^{9} t^{10-t} to read off the total exponent of every prime, then count how many even exponents (0,2,4,…) are possible for each prime factor. 3. [Proof] a) Prime–exponent tally For every integer t≤9, t appears in exactly 10−t of the factorials 1!,2!,…,9!, so 1!·2!·…·9! = ∏_{t=1}^{9} t^{\,10-t}. Prime powers: t : 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 v₂(t): 1 0 2 0 1 0 3 0 v₃(t): 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 Exponent of 2: 1·8 + 2·6 + 1·4 + 3·2 = 30 Exponent of 3: 1·7 + 1·4 + 2·1 = 13 Exponent of 5: 1·5 = 5 Exponent of 7: 1·3 = 3 Thus N = 1!·2!·…·9! = 2³⁰ · 3¹³ · 5⁵ · 7³. b) Counting square divisors For p^e, an even exponent can be chosen in ⌊e/2⌋+1 ways. 2: ⌊30/2⌋+1 = 16 3: ⌊13/2⌋+1 = 7 5: ⌊5/2⌋+1 = 3 7: ⌊3/2⌋+1 = 2 Total perfect squares = 16·7·3·2 = 672. (Alternative: Sum Legendre valuations for each factorial separately, then proceed identically.) 4. [Conclusion] Exactly 672 perfect squares divide 1!·2!·3!·…·9!, so the answer is (B).
