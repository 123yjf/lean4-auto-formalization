-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Two natural numbers sum to 17 402; one ends in 0 and, when that 0 is deleted, the other number appears—find their difference. 2. [Key Idea] Let the number ending in 0 be x; deleting the 0 divides it by 10, so the second number is x⁄10. A simple linear equation then yields both numbers. 3. [Proof] Let x = the multiple of 10, y = the other number. Given y = x⁄10 and x + y = 17 402. Substitute: x + x⁄10 = 17 402 (11/10)x = 17 402 x = 17 402 · 10 / 11 = 15 820. Thus y = x⁄10 = 1 582, and the required difference is x – y = 15 820 – 1 582 = 14 238. (Alternate one-liner: difference = x – x⁄10 = (9/10)x = (9/10)(17 402·10/11) = 14 238.) 4. [Conclusion] The two numbers differ by 14 238, answer (D).
