-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the units digit of the product 1·3·5·7·9·11. 2. [Key Idea] Because the six factors are all odd they contribute no factor 2, yet one of them contributes a single factor 5; a number divisible by 5 but not by 2 always ends in 5. 3. [Proof] Direct computation (mod 10): 1·3 ≡ 3 3·5 ≡ 15 ≡ 5 5·7 ≡ 35 ≡ 5 5·9 ≡ 45 ≡ 5 5·11 ≡ 55 ≡ 5 Hence the product is congruent to 5 (mod 10); its units digit is 5. Structural argument: – Every integer’s units digit depends only on its residue mod 10. – Among 1,3,5,7,9,11 there is exactly one factor 5 and no even factors, so the prime‐factorization of the product contains one factor 5 and no factor 2. – Any integer of the form 5 × (odd) ≡ 5 (mod 10). Therefore the product must end in 5. 4. [Conclusion] The product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 ends with the digit 5.
