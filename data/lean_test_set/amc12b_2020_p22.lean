-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Maximize f(t)=t(2ᵗ−3t)/4ᵗ for all real t. 2. [Key Idea] Write the expression with the single factor t/2ᵗ; the problem then collapses to maximizing a simple quadratic. 3. [Proof] Let x = t / 2ᵗ. (Continuous for all real t) Rewrite f(t): f(t)= t·2⁻ᵗ − 3t²·2⁻²ᵗ = (t/2ᵗ) − 3(t/2ᵗ)² = x − 3x². (*) Step 1 (Maximize the quadratic). g(x)=x−3x² is a downward-opening parabola; its vertex is at g′(x)=1−6x=0 ⇒ x=1/6, and g(1/6)=1/12. Hence, over any interval where x is attainable, the largest possible value of (*) is 1/12. Step 2 (1/6 is attainable). Consider ϕ(t)=t/2ᵗ. ϕ(0)=0, ϕ(1)=1/2>1/6. Since ϕ is continuous and rises from 0 to 1/2 on [0,1], by the Intermediate Value Theorem there exists t₀∈(0,1) with ϕ(t₀)=1/6. Therefore x=1/6 occurs for some real t, and the bound 1/12 is achieved at that t₀. (Any t yielding ϕ(t)=1/6, numerically about t≈0.187, gives the maximum.) 4. [Conclusion] The maximum of t(2ᵗ−3t)/4ᵗ is 1/12, answer (C).
