-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the sum of two positive integers whose product is 2005, given that neither integer equals 1. 2. [Key Idea] Factor 2005; if its prime‐factorization contains only one non-trivial pair of factors, that pair is forced, so the sum is immediate. 3. [Proof] Prime-factorize the number: 2005 ÷ 5 = 401, and 401 is prime (no divisors ≤ √401 ≈ 20). Hence the only factorization of 2005 into integers exceeding 1 is 2005 = 5 · 401. Therefore the two required numbers are 5 and 401, whose sum is 5 + 401 = 406. 4. [Conclusion] Because 2005 has the unique non-trivial factor pair (5, 401), the sum of the two positive whole numbers is 406.
