-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that 11 divides 10ⁿ − (−1)ⁿ for every natural number n. 2. [Key Idea] Because 10 ≡ −1 (mod 11), raising both sides to the n-th power immediately yields 10ⁿ ≡ (−1)ⁿ (mod 11). 3. [Proof] Direct modular argument 10 ≡ −1 (mod 11). ⇒ (10)ⁿ ≡ (−1)ⁿ (mod 11). ⇒ 10ⁿ − (−1)ⁿ ≡ 0 (mod 11). Hence 11 | (10ⁿ − (−1)ⁿ). Alternative: Induction Base n = 1: 10¹ − (−1)¹ = 11, divisible by 11. Inductive step: Assume 11 | (10ᵏ − (−1)ᵏ). Then 10ᵏ ≡ (−1)ᵏ (mod 11). Multiply both sides by 10 to get 10ᵏ⁺¹ ≡ 10·(−1)ᵏ ≡ (−1)ᵏ⁺¹ (mod 11). Thus 11 | (10ᵏ⁺¹ − (−1)ᵏ⁺¹). The proposition holds for all n. 4. [Conclusion] For every natural number n, 10ⁿ and (−1)ⁿ are congruent modulo 11, hence 11 divides their difference.
