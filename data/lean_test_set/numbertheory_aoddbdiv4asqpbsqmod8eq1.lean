-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that if a is odd and b is divisible by 4, then a² + b² ≡ 1 (mod 8). 2. [Key Idea] Squares of odd integers are always 1 mod 8, while squares of multiples of 4 are 0 mod 8; their sum is therefore 1 mod 8. 3. [Proof] Let a = 2m + 1 (some m ∈ ℤ) and b = 4k (some k ∈ ℕ). a² = (2m + 1)² = 4m² + 4m + 1 = 4m(m + 1) + 1. Since m(m + 1) is the product of two consecutive integers, it is even, so 4m(m + 1) is divisible by 8. Hence a² ≡ 1 (mod 8). b² = (4k)² = 16k² = 8·(2k²), clearly divisible by 8, so b² ≡ 0 (mod 8). Therefore a² + b² ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 (mod 8). (Alternate quick check: any odd residue r ∈ {1,3,5,7} satisfies r² ≡ 1 (mod 8); any multiple of 4 has residue 0 or 4, but 4² = 16 ≡ 0 (mod 8) as well.) 4. [Conclusion] Thus, for every odd a and every b divisible by 4, the congruence a² + b² ≡ 1 (mod 8) holds.
