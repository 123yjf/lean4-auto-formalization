-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the remainder of 5^999,999 when divided by 7. 2. [Key Idea] Because 5 and 7 are coprime, Fermat’s Little Theorem (5^6 ≡ 1 mod 7) reduces the huge exponent modulo 6. 3. [Proof] Step 1. Order-reduction of the exponent Fermat: 5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7). Hence 5^k ≡ 5^{k mod 6} (mod 7). Step 2. Evaluate the reduced exponent 999,999 ÷ 6 gives a remainder of 3 (since 999,999 = 166,666·6 + 3). Therefore 5^999,999 ≡ 5^3 (mod 7). Step 3. Final computation 5^3 = 125 → 125 − 17·7 = 125 − 119 = 6. Thus 5^999,999 ≡ 6 (mod 7). (Alternate one-liner: 5^{999,999} ≡ (5^6)^{166,666}·5^3 ≡ 1^{166,666}·5^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7).) 4. [Conclusion] The remainder when 5^999,999 is divided by 7 is 6.
