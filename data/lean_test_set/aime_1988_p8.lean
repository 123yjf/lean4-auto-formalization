-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the value of f(14,52) when f:ℕ²→ℕ satisfies (i) f(x,x)=x, (ii) f(x,y)=f(y,x), (iii) (x+y)f(x,y)=y f(x,x+y). 2. [Key Idea] Divide f(x,y) by xy; the resulting function is invariant under the two elementary steps of the Euclidean algorithm, so it depends only on gcd(x,y). 3. [Proof] Step 1. Linearise. Put g(x,y)=f(x,y)/(xy). Then (iii) gives (x+y)xy g(x,y)=y·x(x+y) g(x,x+y) ⇒ g(x,y)=g(x,x+y). (1) Because f is symmetric, g(x,y)=g(y,x). (2) Step 2. g is a function of the gcd only. Relations (1)–(2) coincide with the moves of the Euclidean algorithm: – (1) replaces the pair (x,y) by (x,x+y) (adding a multiple of one entry to the other); – (2) swaps the entries. Starting from (x,y) and repeatedly applying these moves we reach (d,d), where d=gcd(x,y). Hence g(x,y)=g(d,d). (3) Step 3. Evaluate g(d,d). From (i): f(d,d)=d. Therefore g(d,d)=f(d,d)/(d·d)=d/d²=1/d. Insert this into (3): g(x,y)=1/gcd(x,y). Step 4. Recover f. f(x,y)=xy g(x,y)=xy/ gcd(x,y). (4) Step 5. Compute f(14,52). gcd(14,52)=2, so f(14,52)=14·52 / 2 = 14·26 = 364. 4. [Conclusion] The given axioms force f(x,y)=xy/ gcd(x,y); in particular, f(14,52)=364.
