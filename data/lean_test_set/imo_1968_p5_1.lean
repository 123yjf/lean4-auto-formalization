-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given a>0 and a function f such that f(x+a)=½+√(f(x)−f(x)²) for every real x, prove that f is periodic. 2. [Key Idea] (i) ½+√(t−t²) is always ≥½, so the functional equation forbids values of f below ½. (ii) After translating the relation to F(x)=2f(x)−1 (so 0≤F≤1), the equation becomes a simple involution F(x+a)=√(1−F(x)²), from which F(x+2a)=F(x) and hence f(x+2a)=f(x). 3. [Proof] Step 1 – Eliminate small values. Assume, to the contrary, that f(x₀)<½ for some x₀. Put y=x₀−a. Then f(x₀)=f(y+a)=½+√(f(y)−f(y)²) ≥½, contradicting f(x₀)<½. Hence ∀x∈ℝ, f(x)≥½. (1) Step 2 – A more convenient variable. Define F(x)=2f(x)−1. By (1) we have 0≤F(x)≤1, and the given relation rewrites as F(x+a)=√(1−F(x)²), ∀x. (2) Because F is non–negative, no absolute value is needed. Step 3 – Two–step iteration. Apply (2) twice: F(x+2a)=√(1−F(x+a)²) =√(1−(√(1−F(x)²))²) =√(F(x)²)=F(x). Step 4 – Return to f. Since F(x)=2f(x)−1, the equality F(x+2a)=F(x) yields f(x+2a)=f(x) for every real x. (3) Letting b=2a>0, (3) is exactly the required periodicity. 4. [Conclusion] The function satisfies f(x+2a)=f(x) for all real x, so f is periodic with positive period b=2a.
