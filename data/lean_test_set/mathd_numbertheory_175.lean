-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the units digit of 2^{2010}. 2. [Key Idea] Powers of 2 repeat their units digits in a cycle of length 4, so it suffices to reduce the exponent modulo 4. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (using the cyclic pattern). 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16 (units digit 6). Thus the repeating cycle of units digits is 2 → 4 → 8 → 6 (length 4). Compute 2010 mod 4: 2010 = 4·502 + 2, so 2010 ≡ 2 (mod 4). Therefore 2^{2010} has the same units digit as 2^2, namely 4. Method 2 (using modular arithmetic). In ℤ_{10}, 2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ 6 (mod 10) and hence 2^4 ≡ 6. More importantly, 2^4 ≡ 6 ⇒ 2^5 ≡ 2·6 ≡ 12 ≡ 2, bringing us back to the start; thus 2^4 ≡ 6 implies 2^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5) while 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 10), confirming the length-4 cycle. Since 2010 ≡ 2 (mod 4), 2^{2010} ≡ 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 10). 4. [Conclusion] The units digit of 2^{2010} is 4.
