-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the intersection A of the lines 3y = x and 2x + 5y = 11, and show that the sum of its coordinates x + y equals 4. 2. [Key Idea] Express x from the first line, substitute into the second, solve for y, then back-substitute for x; their sum follows immediately. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (Substitution). 3y = x ⇒ x = 3y. Substitute into 2x + 5y = 11: 2(3y) + 5y = 11 ⟹ 6y + 5y = 11 ⟹ 11y = 11 ⟹ y = 1. Then x = 3y = 3. Hence x + y = 3 + 1 = 4. Method 2 (Elimination). Rewrite the first line as x – 3y = 0. Solve the linear system x – 3y = 0 2x + 5y = 11 Multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract: 2x – 6y = 0 (2x + 5y) – (2x – 6y) = 11 – 0 ⇒ 11y = 11 ⇒ y = 1. Substitute into x – 3·1 = 0 ⇒ x = 3. Therefore x + y = 4. 4. [Conclusion] The coordinates of A are (3, 1), and their sum is indeed 4.
