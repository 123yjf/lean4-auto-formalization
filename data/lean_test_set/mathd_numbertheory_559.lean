-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the least positive integer X such that X ≡ 2 (mod 3) and the last digit of X coincides with the last digit of some integer that is ≡ 4 (mod 5). 2. [Key Idea] An integer ≡ 4 (mod 5) must end in 4 or 9, so X must also end in 4 or 9; testing these endings against the condition X ≡ 2 (mod 3) quickly yields the minimum. 3. [Proof] Direct check a) Possible terminal digits: 4 or 9. b) List the smallest positive numbers with these endings and test mod 3: • 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3) ✗ • 9 ≡ 0 (mod 3) ✗ • 14 ≡ 2 (mod 3) ✔ Hence 14 satisfies both constraints, and any smaller candidate (4 or 9) fails, so 14 is minimal. Alternative modular argument Let d be the units digit of X. i) d ∈ {4, 9} (because d ≡ 4 (mod 5)). ii) Write X = 10k + d. Then 10k + d ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ k + d ≡ 2 (mod 3) since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3). • If d = 4: k + 4 ≡ 2 ⇒ k ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ k = 1 is smallest ⇒ X = 14. • If d = 9: k + 9 ≡ 2 ⇒ k ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ k = 2 is smallest ⇒ X = 29. The smallest possibility from both cases is again X = 14. 4. [Conclusion] The least positive integer meeting the stated conditions is 14.
