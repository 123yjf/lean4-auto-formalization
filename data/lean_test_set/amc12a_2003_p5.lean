-- 1. [Problem Restatement] If the two 5-digit numbers AMC10 and AMC12 add to 123422, determine A + M + C. 2. [Key Idea] Write the numbers in expanded (base-10) form, equate their sum to 123422, then exploit the fact that A, M, C are single digits. 3. [Proof] Let AMC10 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10, AMC12 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12. Their sum is (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22. Set equal to 123422: 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422 ⟹ 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400 ⟹ divide by 200 → 100A + 10M + C = 617. Since A, M, C are digits (A ≠ 0), the only way for 100A + 10M + C to equal 617 is A = 6, M = 1, C = 7 (because 100A must supply the “6-hundreds” and 10M + C must be 17). Thus A + M + C = 6 + 1 + 7 = 14. 4. [Conclusion] The required sum is 14, matching choice (E).
