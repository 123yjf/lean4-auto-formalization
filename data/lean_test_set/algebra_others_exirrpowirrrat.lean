-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find irrational real numbers a, b whose power aᵇ is rational. 2. [Key Idea] Play with a = √2 and its power √2; if √2^√2 is already rational we are done, otherwise raise that (irrational) value to √2 to obtain 2. 3. [Proof] Style A – Classical case split Let b = √2 (known to be irrational) and consider c = √2^√2. • Case 1: c is rational. Take a = √2. Both a and b are irrational and aᵇ = c is rational. • Case 2: c is irrational. Put a = c and keep b = √2. Then aᵇ = (√2^√2)^√2 = √2^{√2·√2} = √2² = 2, a rational number. Either way the required a, b exist. Style B – One–shot choice (uses e) Since e and ln 2 are both irrational, set a = e and b = ln 2; then aᵇ = e^{ln 2} = 2 ∈ ℚ. 4. [Conclusion] Thus there are irrational numbers a and b—explicitly obtainable—whose power aᵇ is rational.
