-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that applying the function f(n)= n² (n odd) n²−4n−1 (n even) five consecutive times to the starting value 4 yields 1. 2. [Key Idea] Compute f once to reach an odd number; from the second application onward the argument is odd, so f(n)=n², which sends −1 to 1 and then fixes 1 forever. 3. [Proof] First application (n even): f(4)=4²−4·4−1=16−16−1=−1. Second application (n odd): f(−1)= (−1)² =1. Third application (n odd): f(1)=1²=1. Fourth application (n odd): f(1)=1. Fifth application (n odd): f(1)=1. Hence f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = 1. 4. [Conclusion] After five iterations the value stabilizes at 1, so the required result is 1.
