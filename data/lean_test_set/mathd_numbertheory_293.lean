-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the digit d that makes the four-digit number 20d7 divisible by 11. 2. [Key Idea] Use the 11-divisibility test: for a₁a₂a₃a₄, the difference (a₁+a₃) − (a₂+a₄) must be a multiple of 11. 3. [Proof] Style A – Divisibility-rule proof Let the number be 20d7 (digits: a₁=2, a₂=0, a₃=d, a₄=7). Compute the alternating sum: (a₁+a₃) − (a₂+a₄) = (2 + d) − (0 + 7) = d − 5. For 20d7 to be a multiple of 11, d − 5 ≡ 0 (mod 11). Since d is a single digit 0–9, the only solution is d = 5. Style B – Modular-arithmetic proof 20d7 = 2000 + 0·100 + 10d + 7 = 2007 + 10d. Because 10 ≡ −1 (mod 11) and 2007 ≡ 2002 + 5 ≡ 5 (mod 11), 2007 + 10d ≡ 5 − d (mod 11). We need 5 − d ≡ 0 (mod 11) ⇒ d ≡ 5 (mod 11). With 0 ≤ d ≤ 9, this again forces d = 5. 4. [Conclusion] Placing 5 in the blank gives 2057, and 2057 ÷ 11 = 187, so 5 is the required digit.
