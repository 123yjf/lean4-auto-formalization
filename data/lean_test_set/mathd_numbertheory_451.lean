-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Which numbers among 2010, 2011, … , 2019 can be written as the sum of the four divisors of some integer that itself has exactly four divisors? 2. [Key Idea] An integer has exactly four divisors iff it is p³ or pq with distinct primes p < q. The corresponding divisor–sums are (1 + p + p² + p³) and (1 + p)(1 + q); only the latter can lie between 2010 and 2019. 3. [Proof] Case 1. m = p³. Sum = 1 + p + p² + p³ = (p⁴–1)/(p–1). For p ≥ 13 this already exceeds 2019, while for p ≤ 11 it is below 2010, so no candidate arises. Case 2. m = pq with primes p < q. Sum n = 1 + p + q + pq = (1 + p)(1 + q). Write a = 1 + p, b = 1 + q; then n = ab with a – 1, b – 1 both prime. We test each n in {2010,…,2019}: • 2010 = 2·3·5·67. Among its factor-pairs (a,b) no pair has both a–1 and b–1 prime. • 2011 is prime ⇒ only pair (1,2011). • 2012 = 4·503 ⇒ (4–1)=3 prime, (503–1)=502 composite. • 2013 = 3·11·61 ⇒ no suitable pair. • 2014 = 2·19·53 ⇒ no suitable pair. • 2015 = 5·13·31 ⇒ no suitable pair. • 2016 = 8·252 with 8–1 = 7 prime and 252–1 = 251 prime. Hence 2016 = (1+7)(1+251) and is nice; the required m is 7·251 = 1757. • 2017 is prime. • 2018 = 2·1009 ⇒ 1009–1 composite. • 2019 = 3·673 ⇒ 673–1 composite. Thus the only nice number in the interval is 2016. 4. [Conclusion] The set {2010,…,2019} contains exactly one nice number, 2016, so the required sum is 2016.
