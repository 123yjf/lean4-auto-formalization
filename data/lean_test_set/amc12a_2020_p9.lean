-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine how many x∈[0,2π] satisfy tan (2x)=cos (x/2). 2. [Key Idea] Write F(x)=tan (2x)−cos (x/2); observe that F is strictly increasing on every interval between the vertical asymptotes of tan (2x), so on each such interval F crosses the x–axis at most once, and a sign check shows it does so every time. 3. [Proof] Let F(x)=tan (2x)−cos (x/2), x∈[0,2π]. a) Strict monotonicity. F′(x)=2 sec²(2x)+½ sin(x/2)>0 everywhere F is defined; hence F is strictly increasing on every open interval where tan (2x) is finite. b) Locate the intervals. tan (2x) has vertical asymptotes at 2x=π/2+kπ (k∈ℤ) ⇒ x=π/4+kπ/2. Inside [0,2π] these are at π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4. Thus F is continuous and strictly increasing on five sub-intervals: I₁=[0,π/4), I₂=(π/4,3π/4), I₃=(3π/4,5π/4), I₄=(5π/4,7π/4), I₅=(7π/4,2π]. c) Sign of F at the ends of each interval. • I₁: F(0)=tan0−cos0=−1<0, F→+∞ as x→π/4⁻. • I₂: F→−∞ as x→π/4⁺, F→+∞ as x→3π/4⁻. • I₃: F→−∞ as x→3π/4⁺, F→+∞ as x→5π/4⁻. • I₄: F→−∞ as x→5π/4⁺, F→+∞ as x→7π/4⁻. • I₅: F→−∞ as x→7π/4⁺, F(2π)=tan4π−cosπ=1>0. Because F is continuous and changes sign on every interval, the Intermediate Value Theorem gives at least one zero in each interval; strict increase gives at most one. Therefore each interval contains exactly one solution. d) Counting the roots. Five intervals ⇒ five distinct solutions on [0,2π]. (Alternative one-line proof: Setting t=x/2 (t∈[0,π]) gives tan 4t−cos t, whose analysis is identical.) 4. [Conclusion] The equation tan (2x)=cos (x/2) has exactly 5 solutions on [0,2π], so the answer is (E) 5.
