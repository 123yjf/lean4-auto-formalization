-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the least integer > 1 that is simultaneously a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. 2. [Key Idea] An integer that is both a 3-rd and a 4-th power must in fact be a 12-th power, and the smallest non-trivial 12-th power is 2¹². 3. [Proof] Let n be a positive integer with n = a³ and n = b⁴. (i) Common-exponent argument • Since n = a³, every prime exponent in the factorization of n is a multiple of 3. • Since n = b⁴, the same exponents are also multiples of 4. • Therefore each exponent is a multiple of lcm(3, 4) = 12, so n = c¹² for some integer c. (ii) Minimality • The smallest integer > 1 of the form c¹² occurs when c = 2, giving n = 2¹² = 4096. • Check: 4096 = 16³ (cube) and 4096 = 8⁴ (fourth power). No smaller integer works, because any candidate must be a 12-th power and 1 < c implies c ≥ 2. 4. [Conclusion] The smallest integer other than 1 that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096.
