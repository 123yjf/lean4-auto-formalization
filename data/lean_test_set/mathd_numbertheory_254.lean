-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given 239 + 174 + 83 marbles, determine how many must be discarded so the remainder can be split into piles of exactly 10 marbles; prove this number is 6. 2. [Key Idea] Count the total marbles and use division-with-remainder (or modular arithmetic) to find what is not a multiple of 10. 3. [Proof] Let S = 239 marbles, W = 174 marbles, Z = 83 marbles. Total marbles T = S + W + Z = 239 + 174 + 83 = 496. Divide T by 10: 496 = 10·49 + 6, so the remainder is 6. Precisely 6 marbles must be removed to leave 10·49 = 490 marbles, which form 49 piles of 10. (Alternate modular view) Compute T mod 10: 239 ≡ 9, 174 ≡ 4, 83 ≡ 3 (mod 10); 9 + 4 + 3 ≡ 16 ≡ 6 (mod 10). Again, 6 marbles prevent divisibility by 10 and must be removed. 4. [Conclusion] Only 6 marbles need to be taken away so the remaining 490 marbles arrange perfectly into piles of ten.
