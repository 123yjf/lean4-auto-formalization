-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Count the 4-digit integers whose digits are all even and that are divisible by 5. 2. [Key Idea] A number divisible by 5 must end in 0 or 5, but the last digit must also be even; hence the units digit is forced to be 0, after which we simply count choices for the remaining even digits. 3. [Proof] Let the 4-digit number be $\overline{d_1d_2d_3d_4}$. • Units digit $d_4$: – Divisibility by 5 ⇒ $d_4\in\{0,5\}$. – Even-digit condition eliminates 5, so $d_4=0$ (1 choice). • Thousands digit $d_1$: – Must be non-zero and even ⇒ $d_1\in\{2,4,6,8\}$ (4 choices). • Hundreds digit $d_2$: – Any even digit ⇒ $d_2\in\{0,2,4,6,8\}$ (5 choices). • Tens digit $d_3$: – Same as $d_2$ ⇒ 5 choices. Total numbers = $4 \times 5 \times 5 \times 1 = 100$. 4. [Conclusion] Exactly 100 such 4-digit integers exist, so the answer is (B) 100.
