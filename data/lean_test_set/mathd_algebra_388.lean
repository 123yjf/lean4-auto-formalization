-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Solve the linear system 3x + 4y − 12z = 10, −2x − 3y + 9z = −4 and show that the value of x is 14. 2. [Key Idea] A single elimination step shows that the y- and z-terms cancel, leaving one equation in x alone. 3. [Proof] Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 4: (3) 9x + 12y − 36z = 30 (4) −8x − 12y + 36z = −16 Add (3) and (4): (9x − 8x) + (12y − 12y) + (−36z + 36z) = 30 + (−16) x = 14. (The variables y and z remain free; the two given equations are sufficient to pin down x uniquely.) 4. [Conclusion] Elimination shows that any solution of the system must satisfy x = 14.
