-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the son’s present age given that the father is now five times as old, and their ages totaled 30 three years ago. 2. [Key Idea] Translate the statements into two linear equations in the unknowns “son’s age (s)” and “father’s age (f)” and solve. 3. [Proof] Let s = son’s age today f = father’s age today Conditions: (i) f = 5s (“five times”) (ii) (f – 3) + (s – 3) = 30 (“three years ago sum was 30”) Simplify (ii): f + s – 6 = 30 ⇒ f + s = 36. Substitute (i) into this: 5s + s = 36 ⇒ 6s = 36 ⇒ s = 6. 4. [Conclusion] The son is 6 years old today.
