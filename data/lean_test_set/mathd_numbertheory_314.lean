-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the least positive multiple of 1342 whose remainder mod 13 is smaller than the remainder of 1342 itself. 2. [Key Idea] Because 1342 ≡ 3 (mod 13), any multiple k·1342 leaves remainder 3k (mod 13); choose the smallest k making 3k ≡ 0, 1, or 2 (mod 13). 3. [Proof] Let r be the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13. 1342 = 13·103 + 3 ⇒ r = 3. For k ∈ ℕ, write N = k·1342. N ≡ k·(1342) ≡ k·3 ≡ 3k (mod 13). We need 3k ≡ 0, 1, or 2 (mod 13). Check k consecutively: k = 1 ⇒ 3·1 ≡ 3 k = 2 ⇒ 3·2 ≡ 6 k = 3 ⇒ 3·3 ≡ 9 k = 4 ⇒ 3·4 ≡ 12 k = 5 ⇒ 3·5 ≡ 15 ≡ 2 ✓ (remainder smaller than 3) Thus the smallest such k is 5, giving N = 5·1342 = 6710. (For completeness, solving 3k ≡ 0 gives k ≡ 0 (mod 13) ⇒ k = 13, and 3k ≡ 1 gives k ≡ 9 (mod 13) ⇒ k = 9; both exceed 5.) 4. [Conclusion] The least positive multiple of 1342 whose remainder upon division by 13 is less than 3 is 6710.
