-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Solve the system a²b³ = 32⁄27 and a ⁄ b³ = 27⁄4 for real a, b and find a + b. 2. [Key Idea] Substitute the expression for a from the second equation into the first; the exponents line up so that b⁹ becomes a perfect power, yielding b = 2⁄3 and hence a = 2. 3. [Proof] Let a = (27⁄4) b³ from a ⁄ b³ = 27⁄4. Substitute into a²b³ = 32⁄27: ((27⁄4) b³)² · b³ = 32⁄27 (27²⁄4²) b⁶ · b³ = 32⁄27 (729⁄16) b⁹ = 32⁄27 Solve for b⁹: b⁹ = (32⁄27) · (16⁄729) = 512⁄19683 = 2⁹ ⁄ 3⁹ Because the ninth root is monotone on ℝ, take the real root: b = 2⁄3. Now find a: a = (27⁄4) b³ = (27⁄4)·(2⁄3)³ = (27⁄4)·(8⁄27) = 2. Therefore a + b = 2 + 2⁄3 = 8⁄3. 4. [Conclusion] The unique real solution gives a + b = 8⁄3.
