-- Proof content:
-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the number y so that the three consecutive terms y + 6, 12, y form an arithmetic sequence. 2. [Key Idea] In any arithmetic sequence the common difference is constant, equivalently the middle term equals the average of its two neighbors. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (using common difference) Let d be the common difference. 12 − (y + 6) = d and y − 12 = d, hence 12 − y − 6 = y − 12 6 − y = y − 12 18 = 2y y = 9. Method 2 (using the averaging property) For three consecutive arithmetic terms a, b, c, b = (a + c)/2. Thus 12 = (y + 6 + y)/2 24 = 2y + 6 18 = 2y y = 9. 4. [Conclusion] The required value is y = 9, yielding the arithmetic sequence 15, 12, 9.
