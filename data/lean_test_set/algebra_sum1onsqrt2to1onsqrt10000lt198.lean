-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that the finite sum of reciprocal square–roots satisfies Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k < 198. 2. [Key Idea] Bound each term 1/√k by an expression whose telescoping (or integral) is elementary, then evaluate the resulting simple expression. 3. [Proof] Telescoping bound a) For every integer k ≥ 2, 1/√k < 2(√k – √(k–1)) (∗) because √k + √(k–1) < 2√k ⇒ 2/(√k+√(k–1)) > 1/√k, and 2(√k – √(k–1)) = 2 / (√k + √(k–1)). b) Sum (∗) from k = 2 to 10000: Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k < 2 Σ_{k=2}^{10000} (√k – √(k–1)) = 2(√10000 – √1) (telescopes) = 2(100 – 1) = 198. Hence Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k < 198. Integral bound (alternative) Since f(x)=1/√x is positive and decreasing, Σ_{k=2}^{10000} 1/√k ≤ ∫_{1}^{10000} 1/√x dx = [2√x]_{1}^{10000} = 198. (The inequality is strict because the integrand is not constant.) 4. [Conclusion] Both comparisons confirm that the sum of reciprocals of square–roots from 2 to 10000 is strictly less than 198.
