-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the least positive integer k for which, no matter what positive integer n is chosen, the three numbers 6n+3, 6n+2 and 6n+1 are all coprime to 6n+k; prove that this minimum k equals 5. 2. [Key Idea] Any acceptable k must share neither the prime 2 (present in 6n+2) nor the prime 3 (present in 6n+3), so k must be coprime to 6, i.e. k ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6); the smallest such candidate, k = 1, clearly fails, while k = 5 succeeds. 3. [Proof] Necessity a) If 2 | k, then 2 divides both 6n+2 and 6n+k, so gcd(6n+2,6n+k) ≥ 2 ≠ 1. b) If 3 | k, then 3 divides both 6n+3 and 6n+k, so gcd(6n+3,6n+k) ≥ 3 ≠ 1. Hence k must be coprime to 6, i.e. k ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6). The first such integer is k = 1, but gcd(6n+1,6n+1)=6n+1 >1, so k=1 fails. Therefore k ≥ 5. Sufficiency for k = 5 Let k = 5 and n be any positive integer. (i) gcd(6n+5, 6n+3) gcd(6n+5,6n+3) = gcd(6n+5 − (6n+3), 6n+3) = gcd(2, 6n+3). 6n+3 is odd, so gcd(2,6n+3)=1. (ii) gcd(6n+5, 6n+2) gcd(6n+5,6n+2) = gcd(6n+5 − (6n+2), 6n+2) = gcd(3, 6n+2). Since 6n ≡ 0 (mod 3), 6n+2 ≡ 2 (mod 3); hence gcd(3,6n+2)=1. (iii) gcd(6n+5, 6n+1) gcd(6n+5,6n+1) = gcd(6n+5 − (6n+1), 6n+1) = gcd(4, 6n+1). 6n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 4) depending on n’s parity, so 6n+1 ≡ 1 or 3 (mod 4); in either case gcd(4,6n+1)=1. Thus for k = 5 we have gcd(6n+5, 6n+3) = gcd(6n+5, 6n+2) = gcd(6n+5, 6n+1) = 1 for every positive n. Minimality We have already eliminated k = 1,2,3,4. Consequently the smallest admissible k is 5. 4. [Conclusion] The least positive integer satisfying the required coprimality for every n is k = 5.
