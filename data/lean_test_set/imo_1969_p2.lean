-- 1. [Problem Restatement] If the weighted cosine sum f(x)=cos(a₁+x)+½ cos(a₂+x)+¼ cos(a₃+x)+⋯+1/2ⁿ⁻¹ cos(aₙ+x) vanishes at two points x₁ and x₂, show that x₂−x₁ is an integral multiple of π. 2. [Key Idea] Write f(x) as the real part of a single complex exponential S e^{ix}; its zeros occur exactly when this exponential is ± i times a constant, i.e. when x differs by multiples of π. 3. [Proof] Complex-exponential translation a. Let S = ∑_{k=1}^{n} 2^{-(k-1)} e^{ia_k}. Then f(x) = Re ( S e^{ix} ), (1) because Re( e^{i(a_k+x)} ) = cos(a_k+x). Non–vanishing of S b. The first term of S has modulus 1. The remaining terms have total modulus at most ½+¼+⋯+1/2^{n-1} = 1−1/2^{n-1} < 1. Hence |S| ≥ 1−(1−1/2^{n-1}) = 1/2^{n-1} > 0, so S ≠ 0. Root description c. Write S = |S| e^{iφ} (φ real). From (1) f(x) = |S| cos(x+φ). Thus f(x)=0 ⇔ cos(x+φ)=0 ⇔ x+φ = π/2 + mπ (m∈ℤ). Hence every root is of the form x = π/2 − φ + mπ. (2) Difference of two roots d. If x₁ and x₂ satisfy (2) with integers m₁,m₂, then x₂ − x₁ = (m₂ − m₁)π = mπ with m∈ℤ. 4. [Conclusion] Any two zeros of f(x) differ by an integer multiple of π, i.e. x₂−x₁ = mπ (m∈ℤ).
