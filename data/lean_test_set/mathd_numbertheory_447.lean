-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the sum of the units-digits of every multiple of 3 from 0 to 50, and show it equals 78. 2. [Key Idea] Because the units-digit of 3k depends only on k (mod 10), the pattern 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7 repeats every ten multiples. 3. [Proof] Let k = 0,1,2,… and consider the multiple 3k. Pattern of units-digits (k = 0…9) : 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7 (sum = 45) Multiples of 3 not exceeding 50 are obtained for k = 0…16 (since 3·16 = 48). Break them into two blocks: • k = 0…9 (10 numbers): sum of units-digits = 45. • k = 10…16 (7 numbers): the pattern restarts, giving the first seven terms 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8 (sum = 33). Total sum = 45 + 33 = 78. Alternative counting: There are 17 multiples; each complete cycle of 10 contributes 45, and the remaining 7 terms contribute 33, so 45 + 33 = 78. 4. [Conclusion] The units-digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 add up to 78.
