-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the smallest positive integer n for which 80325 divides n!. 2. [Key Idea] Factor 80325 into primes and demand that n! supply at least those many prime factors; the largest prime required (17) forces n ≥ 17. 3. [Proof] Factorisation of 80325: 80325 = 3³ · 5² · 7 · 17. For a prime p, the exponent of p in n! is νₚ(n!) = ⌊n/p⌋ + ⌊n/p²⌋ + ⌊n/p³⌋ + … . (i) Take n = 17. • ν₃(17!) = ⌊17/3⌋ + ⌊17/9⌋ = 5 + 1 = 6 ≥ 3. • ν₅(17!) = ⌊17/5⌋ = 3 ≥ 2. • ν₇(17!) = ⌊17/7⌋ = 2 ≥ 1. • ν₁₇(17!) = ⌊17/17⌋ = 1 ≥ 1. Thus 80325 | 17!. (ii) Minimality: any n < 17 lacks the prime 17 in its factorial, so 80325 ∤ n!. Hence the least such n is 17. 4. [Conclusion] The smallest positive integer whose factorial is divisible by 80325 is n = 17.
