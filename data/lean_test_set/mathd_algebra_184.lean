-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the positive number a such that 6, a, b and 1⁄b, a, 54 are (finite) geometric progressions. 2. [Key Idea] In any geometric progression the square of the middle term equals the product of its neighbors; applying this twice gives two simple equations in a and b. 3. [Proof] Style A – “Geometric‐mean” shortcut 1. First progression: a² = 6 b. (1) 2. Second progression: a² = (1⁄b)·54 = 54⁄b. (2) 3. Equate (1) and (2): 6 b = 54⁄b ⇒ 6b² = 54 ⇒ b² = 9 ⇒ b = 3 (positivity). 4. Substitute in (1): a² = 6·3 = 18 ⇒ a = √18 = 3√2 (positivity). Style B – “Common‐ratio” method Let r₁ and r₂ be the common ratios of the two progressions. 1. r₁ = a/6 = b/a ⇒ a² = 6b. (1) 2. r₂ = a/(1⁄b) = a b = 54/a ⇒ a² b = 54. (2) 3. Replace b from (1) in (2): a²·(a²/6) = 54 ⇒ a⁴ = 324 ⇒ a = 3√2. 4. [Conclusion] The only positive value satisfying both geometric progressions is a = 3√2.
