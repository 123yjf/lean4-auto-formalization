-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given four breath-holding times A, B, C, D (in minutes) that satisfy (i) B+C+D = 3A, (ii) A+C+D = 4B, (iii) A+B+D = 2C, (iv) 8A+10B+6C = 24, find D as a reduced fraction and show that its numerator plus denominator equals 28. 2. [Key Idea] Use the first three equations to express B, C, D in terms of A, then insert these into the fourth equation to determine A and hence D. 3. [Proof] Step 1: Eliminate D. From (i) D = 3A − B − C. (1) Step 2: Substitute (1) into (ii). A + C + (3A − B − C) = 4B 4A − 5B = 0 ⇒ B = (4/5)A. (2) Step 3: Substitute (1) into (iii). A + B + (3A − B − C) = 2C 4A − 3C = 0 ⇒ C = (4/3)A. (3) Step 4: Find D from (1) using (2)–(3). D = 3A − (4/5)A − (4/3)A = A(3 − 4/5 − 4/3) = A(45/15 − 12/15 − 20/15) = (13/15)A. (4) Step 5: Determine A from the fourth given equation. 8A + 10B + 6C = 24 Using (2)–(3): 8A + 10·(4/5)A + 6·(4/3)A = 8A + 8A + 8A = 24A Thus 24A = 24 ⇒ A = 1. Step 6: Evaluate D. From (4): D = (13/15)·1 = 13/15. 4. [Conclusion] David’s time is 13/15 minutes, so numerator + denominator = 13 + 15 = 28.
