-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the overall mean score when the morning class averages 84, the afternoon class averages 70, and their sizes are in the ratio 3 : 4. 2. [Key Idea] The overall mean is just the weighted average of the two class means, with weights proportional to their class sizes. 3. [Proof] Let the number of students in the morning and afternoon classes be 3k and 4k, respectively. Overall mean = (total points) / (total students) = (84·3k + 70·4k) / (3k + 4k) = (252k + 280k) / 7k = 532k / 7k = 532 / 7 = 76. (Alternate quick check) Weighted-average formula: μ = (3/7)·84 + (4/7)·70 = 36 + 40 = 76. 4. [Conclusion] The mean score for all students is 76, choice (C).
