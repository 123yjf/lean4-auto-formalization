-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that for real numbers a, b with a² + b² = 1 we always have ab + (a − b) ≤ 1. 2. [Key Idea] Convert the inequality to a product of two obvious non-negative factors. 3. [Proof] Direct algebra. ab + (a − b) ≤ 1 ⇔ 1 − ab − a + b ≥ 0 ⇔ 1 + b − a − ab ≥ 0 ⇔ (1 − a)(1 + b) ≥ 0. Because a² + b² = 1 we have −1 ≤ a ≤ 1 and −1 ≤ b ≤ 1, hence 1 − a ≥ 0 and 1 + b ≥ 0. The product of two non-negative numbers is non-negative, so (1 − a)(1 + b) ≥ 0, giving the desired inequality. Alternative (trigonometric) proof. Write a = cos θ, b = sin θ. Then ab + (a − b)=sin θ cos θ+cos θ−sin θ =½ sin 2θ+cos θ−sin θ =1−(1−cos θ)(1+sin θ) ≤ 1 since (1−cos θ)(1+sin θ) ≥ 0 for all θ. 4. [Conclusion] Hence, for every pair (a, b) on the unit circle, ab + (a − b) never exceeds 1.
