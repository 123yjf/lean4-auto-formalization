-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine how many integers n with 15 ≤ n ≤ 85 are divisible by 20. 2. [Key Idea] Count the multiples of 20 up to 85, then subtract the multiples of 20 that lie below 15. 3. [Proof] Let ⌊x⌋ denote the greatest integer ≤ x. a) Formula method • Multiples of 20 not exceeding 85: ⌊85 / 20⌋ = 4. • Multiples of 20 not exceeding 14 (one less than the lower bound 15): ⌊14 / 20⌋ = 0. • Desired count = 4 – 0 = 4. b) Direct listing 20, 40, 60, 80 are the only multiples of 20 between 15 and 85, yielding 4 numbers. 4. [Conclusion] Exactly four integers in the interval 15 ≤ n ≤ 85 are divisible by 20.
