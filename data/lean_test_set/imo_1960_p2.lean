-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find all real x (for which the expressions are defined) such that 4x² / (1 – √(2x+1))² < 2x + 9. 2. [Key Idea] Replace √(2x+1) with a single variable t, cancel the common (t–1)² factor, and reduce the inequality to a linear one in t. 3. [Proof] Let t = √(2x+1). Domain: 2x+1 ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≥ –½, and 1–t ≠ 0 ⇒ t ≠ 1 (i.e. x ≠ 0). The inequality becomes (t²–1)² / (1–t)² < t² + 8. Factor and cancel: (t²–1) = (t–1)(t+1), hence [(t–1)²(t+1)²] / (1–t)² = (t+1)² < t² + 8. Thus t² + 2t + 1 < t² + 8 2t + 1 < 8 t < 7/2. Because t = √(2x+1) ≥ 0, we have 0 ≤ t < 7/2, t ≠ 1. Re-translate to x: 0 ≤ √(2x+1) < 7/2 ⇒ –½ ≤ x < 45/8, and exclude x = 0 (t = 1). So the solution set is x ∈ [–½, 0) ∪ (0, 45/8). 4. [Conclusion] The inequality holds exactly for all x with –½ ≤ x < 45/8, except x = 0.
