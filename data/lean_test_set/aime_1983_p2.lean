-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For 0 < p < 15 and p ≤ x ≤ 15, show that the minimum of f(x)=|x−p|+|x−15|+|x−p−15| equals 15. 2. [Key Idea] On the interval [p,15] every absolute value has a fixed sign, so f(x) becomes the simple linear function 30−x, whose minimum is attained at x=15. 3. [Proof] Algebraic proof a) For p ≤ x ≤ 15 we have |x−p| = x−p (since x≥p), |x−15| = 15−x (since x≤15), |x−p−15| = −(x−p−15) = 15+p−x (because x≤15<p+15). b) Hence f(x) = (x−p) + (15−x) + (15+p−x) = 30 − x. c) Because 30−x decreases with x, its smallest value on [p,15] is obtained at the right endpoint x=15: f_min = 30 − 15 = 15. Geometric proof Place the three fixed points A=p, B=15, C=p+15 on the number line. For x confined to [p,15], point C lies to the right of x, while A lies to the left, and B bounds the interval’s right end. Moving x rightward shortens the distances to both C and B by exactly the distance it moves, yet lengthens the distance to A by the same amount; the net change is −Δx. Therefore the sum f(x) decreases at unit rate as x moves right, reaching its minimum at x=15, where f(15)=15. 4. [Conclusion] Regardless of p (0<p<15), the minimal value of f(x) over p ≤ x ≤ 15 is 15.
