-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that the Diophantine equation x⁵ = y² + 4 has no integer solutions. 2. [Key Idea] Reduce the equation modulo 11: x⁵ can only be 0, 1, or 10 (≡ –1) mod 11, whereas y² + 4 never attains those residues. 3. [Proof] Let x, y ∈ ℤ and consider the equation x⁵ = y² + 4 mod 11. Step 1. Possible fifth-power residues mod 11. By Fermat’s little theorem, for any a not divisible by 11, a¹⁰ ≡ 1 (mod 11); hence a⁵ ≡ ±1 (mod 11). If 11 | a, then a⁵ ≡ 0. Thus x⁵ ≡ 0, 1, 10 (mod 11). Step 2. Possible values of y² + 4 mod 11. The quadratic residues mod 11 are 0²≡0, 1²≡1, 2²≡4, 3²≡9, 4²≡5, 5²≡3. Hence y² takes the set {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}. Adding 4 gives {4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 2} mod 11. Step 3. Comparison. The two sets of possible residues are x⁵: {0, 1, 10} y² + 4: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}. They are disjoint; no residue matches. Therefore no integers x and y can satisfy x⁵ ≡ y² + 4 (mod 11), so the original equation x⁵ = y² + 4 has no integer solutions. 4. [Conclusion] Because the required congruence fails modulo 11, the equation x⁵ = y² + 4 admits no integer solutions.
