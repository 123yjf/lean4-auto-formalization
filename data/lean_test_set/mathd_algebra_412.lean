-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given two real numbers whose sum is 25 and whose difference is 11, determine the larger number. 2. [Key Idea] Express the numbers as simultaneous equations in two unknowns and solve; alternatively, observe that adding the sum and the difference isolates twice the larger number. 3. [Proof] Let the numbers be x (larger) and y (smaller). (1) x + y = 25 (2) x − y = 11 Add (1) and (2): 2x = 25 + 11 = 36 ⇒ x = 36 / 2 = 18. Hence the larger number is 18. Alternative one-line argument: (sum + difference)/2 = (25 + 11)/2 = 18. 4. [Conclusion] The larger of the two numbers is 18.
