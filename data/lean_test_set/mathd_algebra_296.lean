-- 1. [Problem Restatement] A 3491 × 3491 square is altered to (3491 − 60) × (3491 + 60); determine the resulting change in area. 2. [Key Idea] Multiply the new side–lengths and compare with the original area, or observe that one loses and gains congruent rectangles except for a 60 × 60 square. 3. [Proof] Algebraic proof Original area: 3491². New area: (3491 − 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491² − 60² (by the difference-of-squares identity). Change in area: (3491² − 60²) − 3491² = −60² = −3600. Hence the area decreases by 3600. Geometric proof Remove a 60-unit strip from one side (area = 60 × 3491) and attach it to the adjacent side, creating a 60 × 60 overlap that must be cut off. Lost area: 60 × 3491. Gained area: 60 × 3491. Net effect: only the overlapped 60 × 60 square is discarded, so the decrease is 60² = 3600. 4. [Conclusion] The alteration reduces the square’s area by exactly 3600 square units.
