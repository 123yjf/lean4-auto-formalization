-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the unique positive integer N that maximises f(n)=d(n)/n^{1/3} and determine the sum of its digits. 2. [Key Idea] When the exponent of a prime p in n=∏p^{a} is increased by 1, f(n) is multiplied by ((a+2)/(a+1)) / p^{1/3}. Continue raising that exponent only while this factor exceeds 1; this gives an explicit upper bound for every exponent and quickly narrows the search to a single integer. 3. [Proof] Let n=∏_{i}p_i^{a_i} (p_1=2<p_2=3<⋯). Then f(n)=∏_{i}\dfrac{a_i+1}{p_i^{a_i/3}}. Step-up criterion. Increase a_j to a_j+1. The new value of f is f’ = f· \dfrac{a_j+2}{a_j+1}·\dfrac{1}{p_j^{1/3}}. Thus f’>f ⇔ (a_j+2)/(a_j+1) > p_j^{1/3}. (1) At the (unique) maximum N, (1) must fail for every prime factor, i.e. (a_j+2)/(a_j+1) ≤ p_j^{1/3}. (2) Conversely, if (2) already holds, raising a_j would reduce f, so the largest a_j for which (1) is true is the optimal exponent. Apply (1) prime by prime. • p=2 (2)^{1/3}=1.26… a=0: 2/1.26>1 Keep going a=1: 1.5/1.26>1 Keep going a=2: 1.333/1.26>1 Keep going a=3: 1.25/1.26<1 Stop ⇒ a_2 =3. • p=3 (3)^{1/3}=1.44… a=0: 2/1.44>1 Keep going a=1: 1.5/1.44>1 Keep going a=2: 1.333/1.44<1 Stop ⇒ a_3 =2. • p=5 (5)^{1/3}=1.71… a=0: 2/1.71>1 Keep going a=1: 1.5/1.71<1 Stop ⇒ a_5 =1. • p=7 (7)^{1/3}=1.91… a=0: 2/1.91>1 Keep going a=1: 1.5/1.91<1 Stop ⇒ a_7 =1. • p≥11 p^{1/3} ≥ 11^{1/3}≈2.22, and already 2/2.22<1, so no larger prime can appear. Hence N = 2^{3}·3^{2}·5^{1}·7^{1} = 2520. Uniqueness follows because for each prime the exponent is forced to be the greatest integer for which (1) holds; the resulting collection of exponents is therefore unique. 4. [Conclusion] N=2520, and its digit sum is 2+5+2+0 = 9, so the answer is (E) 9.
