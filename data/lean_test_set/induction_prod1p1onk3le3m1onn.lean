-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that for every positive integer n, ∏_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/k³) ≤ 3 − 1/n. 2. [Key Idea] Apply mathematical induction: multiplying the inductive bound by the next factor reduces to a simple inequality that is always true. 3. [Proof] Induction proof. Let P_n = ∏_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/k³). Base case (n = 1). P₁ = 1 + 1 = 2 = 3 − 1, so the claim holds. Induction step. Assume P_n ≤ 3 − 1/n for some n ≥ 1. Then P_{n+1} = P_n (1 + 1/(n+1)³) ≤ (3 − 1/n) (1 + 1/(n+1)³). We must show (3 − 1/n) (1 + 1/(n+1)³) ≤ 3 − 1/(n+1). (★) Rewrite (★): 3 − 1/n + (3 − 1/n)/(n+1)³ ≤ 3 − 1/(n+1) ⇔ 1/[n(n+1)] ≥ (3 − 1/n)/(n+1)³ ⇔ (n+1)²/n ≥ 3 − 1/n ⇔ n + 2 + 1/n ≥ 3 − 1/n ⇔ n − 1 + 2/n ≥ 0, which is true for all n ≥ 1. Hence (★) holds, completing the inductive step. By induction, the inequality is valid for every positive integer n. 4. [Conclusion] Therefore, for all n ∈ ℕ, ∏_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/k³) ≤ 3 − 1/n.
