-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given a₇ = 30 and a₁₁ = 60 in an arithmetic sequence, find a₂₁. 2. [Key Idea] In an arithmetic sequence every term is a linear function of its index, so subtracting two known terms yields the common difference d, after which any desired term follows immediately. 3. [Proof] Let the first term be a₁ = a and the common difference be d. Then a₇ = a + 6d = 30, a₁₁ = a + 10d = 60. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (a + 10d) − (a + 6d) = 60 − 30 4d = 30 ⟹ d = 7.5. Substituting d back into a₇ = 30: a + 6(7.5) = 30 ⟹ a = −15. Now compute the 21-st term: a₂₁ = a + 20d = (−15) + 20(7.5) = −15 + 150 = 135. (Alternative one-line check: each step adds 7.5; from the 11-th term move forward 10 steps: 60 + 10·7.5 = 135.) 4. [Conclusion] The 21st term of the given arithmetic sequence is 135.
