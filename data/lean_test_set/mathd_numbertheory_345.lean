-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the remainder when the sum 2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006 is divided by 7. 2. [Key Idea] Either view the seven consecutive integers as forming a complete residue system modulo 7, or observe that their sum is 7 times their average, hence a multiple of 7. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (residues). • Compute each term modulo 7: 2000≡5, 2001≡6, 2002≡0, 2003≡1, 2004≡2, 2005≡3, 2006≡4. • Sum of residues: 5+6+0+1+2+3+4 = 21 ≡ 0 (mod 7). Therefore the original sum is congruent to 0 modulo 7. Method 2 (arithmetic mean). • Seven consecutive integers have average (first + last)/2 = (2000+2006)/2 = 2003. • Their sum is 7 × 2003, clearly divisible by 7. 4. [Conclusion] The sum 2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006 leaves remainder 0 upon division by 7.
