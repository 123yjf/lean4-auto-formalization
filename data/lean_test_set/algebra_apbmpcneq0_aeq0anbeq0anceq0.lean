-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that the only rational solution of a + bm + cn = 0, where m³ = 2 and n³ = 4, is a = b = c = 0. 2. [Key Idea] Write n as m² (because 4 = 2²) so the relation becomes a + bm + cm² = 0; since the minimal polynomial of m over ℚ is x³ – 2, the set {1, m, m²} is ℚ–linearly independent. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (via minimal polynomial). • Note n = (4)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3} = m². • Suppose a + bm + cm² = 0 with a, b, c ∈ ℚ. • Then m is a root of the quadratic q(x) = cx² + bx + a ∈ ℚ[x]. • But m’s minimal polynomial over ℚ is x³ – 2, which is irreducible (Eisenstein with p = 2); hence any non-zero polynomial in ℚ[x] that vanishes at m must have degree ≥ 3. • Therefore q(x) must be the zero polynomial: a = b = c = 0. Method 2 (linear-independence argument). • The field ℚ(m) has degree 3 over ℚ, so {1, m, m²} is a basis. • A ℚ–linear relation a·1 + b·m + c·m² = 0 expresses 0 in this basis. • In a basis representation all coefficients are unique; hence a = b = c = 0. 4. [Conclusion] Because {1, m, m²} is ℚ–linearly independent, the equation a + bm + cn = 0 forces the rational coefficients to vanish, so a = b = c = 0.
