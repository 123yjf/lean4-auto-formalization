-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the positive integer n for which log₂(log₁₆ n) = log₄(log₄ n), and compute the sum of its digits. 2. [Key Idea] Introduce x = log₄ n so that every logarithm is expressed in base 2; the resulting linear equation in log₂ x immediately yields n. 3. [Proof] Let x = log₄ n (so n = 4ˣ). Left–hand side log₂(log₁₆ n) = log₂( log₄ n / log₄ 16 ) = log₂( x / 2 ) = log₂ x – 1. Right–hand side log₄(log₄ n) = log₄ x = (1/2)·log₂ x. Equation log₂ x – 1 = (1/2)·log₂ x ⟹ (1/2)·log₂ x = 1 ⟹ log₂ x = 2 ⟹ x = 2² = 4. Recover n log₄ n = 4 ⟹ n = 4⁴ = 256. Digit sum 2 + 5 + 6 = 13. 4. [Conclusion] The unique integer is n = 256, whose digits sum to 13, option (E).
