-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Seven cubes of side 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are stacked from largest to smallest; find the total exposed surface area of the resulting tower. 2. [Key Idea] Add the surface areas of the individual cubes and subtract the two faces (one on each cube) that disappear at each of the six touching interfaces. 3. [Proof] Let s₁=7, s₂=6, …, s₇=1 be the side lengths from bottom to top. a) Surface area if the cubes were separate Σ 6sᵢ² = 6(1²+2²+3²+4²+5²+6²+7²) = 6·140 = 840. b) Hidden area at each interface For the interface whose upper cube has side t, its entire bottom face (t²) and the covered portion of the lower cube’s top face (also t²) disappear; total loss 2t². Interfaces and their t-values: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Hidden area = 2(6²+5²+4²+3²+2²+1²) = 2·91 = 182. c) Exposed surface area 840 – 182 = 658. 4. [Conclusion] The tower’s total surface area is 658 square units, choice (B).
