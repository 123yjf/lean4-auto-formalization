-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Count the positive integers n for which (n + 1000)/70 equals ⌊√n⌋. 2. [Key Idea] Set k = ⌊√n⌋, so n = 70k − 1000, and force this value to lie in the interval k² ≤ n < (k+1)² that defines the floor. 3. [Proof] Let k = ⌊√n⌋ (k ∈ ℕ, k ≥ 1). Then n = 70k − 1000 and the defining inequalities for the floor give k² ≤ 70k − 1000 < (k + 1)². (1) Solve each side of (1). a) Lower bound k² − 70k + 1000 ≤ 0. The quadratic has roots 20 and 50, so 20 ≤ k ≤ 50. (2) b) Upper bound 70k − 1000 < (k + 1)² ⇔ k² − 68k + 1001 > 0. Roots: (68 ± √620)/2 ≈ 21.55 and 46.45. Because the quadratic opens upward, k < 21.55 or k > 46.45. (3) Combine (2) and (3): k ∈ {20, 21} ∪ {47, 48, 49, 50}. Six integer values. For each such k, n = 70k − 1000 is positive and satisfies the original equation: k=20→n=400, k=21→470, k=47→2290, k=48→2360, k=49→2430, k=50→2500. 4. [Conclusion] Exactly 6 positive integers satisfy the condition, so the answer is (C) 6.
