-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that the quadratic expression a(2 − a) never exceeds 1 for any real number a. 2. [Key Idea] Rewrite 1 − a(2 − a) as a perfect square; a square is always non-negative, so a(2 − a) is always ≤ 1. 3. [Proof] Algebraic proof (one-line factorization) 1 − a(2 − a) = 1 − 2a + a² = (a − 1)² ≥ 0 ⇒ a(2 − a) ≤ 1. Alternative proof (calculus) f(a) = a(2 − a) = −a² + 2a. f ′(a) = −2a + 2 ⇒ f ′(a)=0 at a=1. f ″(a) = −2 < 0, so a = 1 is the global maximum, with f(1) = 1. Hence f(a) ≤ 1 for every real a. 4. [Conclusion] Because 1 − a(2 − a) = (a − 1)² ≥ 0, the inequality a(2 − a) ≤ 1 holds for all real a.
