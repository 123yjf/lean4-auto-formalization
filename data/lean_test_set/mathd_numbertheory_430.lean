-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the distinct digits A, B, C ∈ {1,…,9} satisfying (i) A + B = C, (ii) 11A – B = 2C, (iii) CB = 11A + A, and compute A + B + C. 2. [Key Idea] Translate the two–digit number AA into 11A, eliminate C with A + B = C, and use digit bounds (1–9) to pin down the only admissible value of A. 3. [Proof] Step 1: Express AA as 11A and substitute C = A + B into equation (ii): 11A – B = 2(A + B) ⇒ 11A – B = 2A + 2B ⇒ 9A – 3B = 0 ⇒ B = 3A. (1) Step 2: Because B is a digit, 3A ≤ 9 ⇒ A ≤ 3. Also A, B are distinct, so A ≠ 3A, hence A ≠ 0. Step 3: Use C = A + B with B = 3A: C = A + 3A = 4A (2) Being a digit forces 4A ≤ 9 ⇒ A ≤ 2. Step 4: Test the two remaining possibilities. • A = 1 → B = 3, C = 4. Equation (iii): C·B = 4·3 = 12, 11A + A = 11 + 1 = 12 ✓ • A = 2 → B = 6, C = 8. Equation (iii): C·B = 8·6 = 48, 11A + A = 22 + 2 = 24 ✗ Only (A, B, C) = (1, 3, 4) works. Therefore A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. 4. [Conclusion] The unique solution gives A + B + C = 8.
