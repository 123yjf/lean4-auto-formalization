-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Given 3x + y = 17, 5y + z = 14 and 3x + 5z = 41, find x + y + z. 2. [Key Idea] Add the three equations; the coefficients of x, y, z all become equal, letting their common factor be divided out immediately. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (one–step combination) 3x + y = 17 5y + z = 14 3x + 5z = 41 ———————————— 6x + 6y + 6z = 72 (add) x + y + z = 72⁄6 = 12. Method 2 (elimination, for completeness) y = 17 − 3x (from the first equation) z = 14 − 5y = 14 − 5(17 − 3x) = 15x − 71 Insert in 3x + 5z = 41: 3x + 5(15x − 71) = 41 ⇒ 78x = 396 ⇒ x = 66⁄13. Then y = 17 − 3·66⁄13 = 23⁄13 and z = 67⁄13, so x + y + z = (66 + 23 + 67)⁄13 = 156⁄13 = 12. 4. [Conclusion] The required sum is x + y + z = 12.
