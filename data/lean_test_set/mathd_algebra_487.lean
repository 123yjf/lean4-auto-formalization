-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the distance between the two points where the parabola y = x² meets the line x + y = 1. 2. [Key Idea] Solve the system to get the two intersection points, then apply the distance formula; the x- and y-differences turn out to be the same in magnitude, making the calculation immediate. 3. [Proof] Algebraic proof a) Substitute y = 1 – x into y = x²: x² = 1 – x ⇔ x² + x – 1 = 0. b) Solve the quadratic: x = [–1 ± √(1+4)]/2 = (–1 ± √5)/2. c) Hence the two intersection points are P₁ = ((–1+√5)/2, (3–√5)/2) P₂ = ((–1–√5)/2, (3+√5)/2). d) Compute the coordinate differences: Δx = (–1+√5)/2 – (–1–√5)/2 = √5 Δy = (3–√5)/2 – (3+√5)/2 = –√5. e) Distance: |P₁P₂| = √[(Δx)² + (Δy)²] = √[ (√5)² + (–√5)² ] = √(5+5) = √10. (Minimal geometric remark) Because the line x + y = 1 has slope –1, the segment P₁P₂ is parallel to it; equal absolute differences in x and y are therefore expected, matching the calculation above. 4. [Conclusion] The two intersection points are √10 units apart.
