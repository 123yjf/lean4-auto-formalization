-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the product of the real roots of x² + 18x + 30 = 2 √(x² + 18x + 45). 2. [Key Idea] Complete the square, reduce the equation to a quadratic in one new variable, and exploit Vieta’s formula for the final product. 3. [Proof] Step 1. Complete the square. x² + 18x = (x + 9)² – 81 Hence LHS = (x + 9)² – 81 + 30 = (x + 9)² – 51 RHS = 2 √[(x + 9)² – 81 + 45] = 2 √[(x + 9)² – 36]. Step 2. Introduce u = (x + 9)² (so u ≥ 0). Equation becomes u – 51 = 2 √(u – 36), u ≥ 36. (1) Step 3. Let v = √(u – 36) (v ≥ 0 ⇒ u = v² + 36). Substitute into (1): (v² + 36) – 51 = 2v ⟺ v² – 2v – 15 = 0 ⟹ (v – 5)(v + 3) = 0 ⇒ v = 5 (v = –3 is rejected since v ≥ 0). Step 4. Back–substitute. u = v² + 36 = 25 + 36 = 61 (x + 9)² = 61 ⇒ x = –9 ± √61. Step 5. Verify both roots. For x = –9 ± √61, LHS = u – 51 = 61 – 51 = 10, RHS = 2 √(u – 36) = 2·5 = 10, so both satisfy the original equation. Step 6. Product of the roots. (–9 + √61)(–9 – √61) = (–9)² – (√61)² = 81 – 61 = 20. 4. [Conclusion] The product of the real roots is 020 (i.e. 20).
