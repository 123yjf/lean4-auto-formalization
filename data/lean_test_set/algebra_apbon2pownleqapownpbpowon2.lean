-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that for all positive reals a, b and every positive integer n, ((a + b)/2)ⁿ ≤ (aⁿ + bⁿ)/2. 2. [Key Idea] The map x ↦ xⁿ (n ≥ 1) is convex on (0,∞); Jensen’s inequality (or any convexity argument) immediately yields the result. 3. [Proof] Proof 1 – Convexity (Jensen). The second derivative of f(x)=xⁿ is f ''(x)=n(n–1)x^{n–2} ≥ 0, so f is convex. For the two points a and b with equal weights ½, f((a+b)/2) ≤ ( f(a)+f(b) ) /2 ⟺ ((a+b)/2)ⁿ ≤ (aⁿ+bⁿ)/2. ∎ Proof 2 – Induction and elementary algebra. Base case n=1: equality holds. Inductive step: assume ((a+b)/2)ᵏ ≤ (aᵏ+bᵏ)/2 for some k ≥ 1. Then ((a+b)/2)^{k+1}=((a+b)/2)ᵏ·(a+b)/2 ≤ (aᵏ+bᵏ)/2 · (a+b)/2 (by induction) = a^{k+1}+aᵏb+abᵏ+b^{k+1} over 4. It suffices to show a^{k+1}+b^{k+1} ≥ aᵏb+abᵏ. Rewrite the difference: (a^{k+1}+b^{k+1}) – (aᵏb+abᵏ) = aᵏ(a–b)+bᵏ(b–a) = (a–b)(aᵏ–bᵏ)= (a–b)²(a^{k–1}+a^{k–2}b+···+b^{k–1}) ≥ 0. Hence ((a+b)/2)^{k+1} ≤ (a^{k+1}+b^{k+1})/2, completing the induction. ∎ 4. [Conclusion] For every positive integer n, the arithmetic mean of a and b raised to n never exceeds the arithmetic mean of their nth powers.
