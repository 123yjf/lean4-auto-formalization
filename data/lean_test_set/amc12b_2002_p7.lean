-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find three consecutive positive integers whose product equals eight times their sum, then compute the sum of their squares. 2. [Key Idea] Name the middle integer n; the conditions reduce to the single quadratic n² – 1 = 24, giving n directly. 3. [Proof] Let the integers be n – 1, n, n + 1 (n > 0). Product: (n – 1)n(n + 1) = n(n² – 1). Sum: (n – 1)+n+(n + 1) = 3n. Given n(n² – 1) = 8·3n = 24n. n ≠ 0 ⇒ divide by n: n² – 1 = 24 ⇒ n² = 25 ⇒ n = 5. The integers are 4, 5, 6; their squares sum to 4² + 5² + 6² = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77. 4. [Conclusion] The sum of the squares is 77, choice (B).
