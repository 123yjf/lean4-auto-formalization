-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that whenever 2ⁿ − 1 is prime, the exponent n itself must be prime. 2. [Key Idea] If n were composite, write n = ab with 1 < a, b; the algebraic identity xᵇ − 1 = (x − 1)(x^{b−1}+⋯+1) then forces 2ⁿ − 1 to factor non-trivially. 3. [Proof] Let n be a positive integer and suppose 2ⁿ − 1 is prime. Assume, for contradiction, that n is composite; then n = ab with integers a > 1 and b > 1. Set x = 2ᵃ. Then 2ⁿ − 1 = 2^{ab} − 1 = xᵇ − 1. Apply the factorization formula: xᵇ − 1 = (x − 1)(x^{b−1} + x^{b−2} + ⋯ + x + 1). Both factors exceed 1 because x − 1 = 2ᵃ − 1 ≥ 3 − 1 = 2 > 1, and x^{b−1} + ⋯ + 1 ≥ 1 + 1 = 2 > 1. Hence 2ⁿ − 1 has a non-trivial factorization, contradicting its assumed primality. Therefore n cannot be composite; thus n is prime. (Alternative style: direct divisibility) If n = ab with a, b > 1, then 2ᵃ − 1 divides 2^{ab} − 1 (a standard result of modular arithmetic), so 1 < 2ᵃ − 1 < 2ⁿ − 1, again contradicting primality. 4. [Conclusion] Because a composite exponent forces 2ⁿ − 1 to factor, 2ⁿ − 1 can be prime only when n itself is prime.
