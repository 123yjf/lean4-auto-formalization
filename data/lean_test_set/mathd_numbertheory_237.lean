-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the remainder when the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 100 is divided by 6. 2. [Key Idea] Either use the closed-form n(n+1)/2 for the sum of the first n integers or observe the repeating pattern of residues modulo 6. 3. [Proof] Style A – Formula. Let S = 1 + 2 + … + 100. S = 100·101 / 2 = 5050. Compute 5050 mod 6: 5050 = 6·841 + 4 ⇒ S ≡ 4 (mod 6). Style B – Residue pattern. The residues of consecutive integers mod 6 cycle 1,2,3,4,5,0 every six terms; their sum is 15 ≡ 3 (mod 6). There are 16 full cycles in 1,…,96, giving residue 16·3 ≡ 48 ≡ 0 (mod 6). Add the last four terms 97,98,99,100 with residues 1,2,3,4 summing to 10 ≡ 4 (mod 6). Hence the total sum ≡ 0 + 4 ≡ 4 (mod 6). 4. [Conclusion] The sum 1 + 2 + … + 100 leaves a remainder of 4 upon division by 6.
