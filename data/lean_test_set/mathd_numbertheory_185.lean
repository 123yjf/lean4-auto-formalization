-- 1. [Problem Restatement] A number that leaves remainder 3 upon division by 5 must yield what remainder when doubled and again divided by 5? 2. [Key Idea] Use modular arithmetic: if a ≡ r (mod 5), then any linear combination of a is congruent to the same combination of r modulo 5. 3. [Proof] Let the unknown integer be n. Since dividing n by 5 leaves remainder 3, n ≡ 3 (mod 5). Multiply both sides by 2: 2n ≡ 2·3 = 6 (mod 5). Reduce 6 modulo 5: 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Hence 2n leaves remainder 1 when divided by 5. 4. [Conclusion] Doubling the given number changes the remainder from 3 to 1 modulo 5.
