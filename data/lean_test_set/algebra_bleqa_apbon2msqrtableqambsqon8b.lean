-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Prove that for positive real numbers with b ≤ a, (a + b)/2 − √(ab) ≤ (a − b)² /(8b). 2. [Key Idea] Replace a and b by their square roots to factor out (√a − √b)²; after cancelling this non-negative term the remaining inequality becomes the obvious 4b ≤ (√a + √b)². 3. [Proof] Let t = √a and s = √b (so t ≥ s > 0). Multiply the desired inequality by 8b (= 8s²) to remove denominators: 8s² [ (a + b)/2 − √{ab} ] ≤ (a − b)². (1) Compute the left-hand side: 8s² [ (t² + s²)/2 − ts ] = 4s²( t² + s² − 2ts ) = 4s²( t − s )². (2) Compute the right-hand side: (a − b)² = (t² − s²)² = (t + s)² (t − s)². (3) Substituting (2) and (3) into (1) and cancelling the common non-negative factor (t − s)² yields 4s² ≤ (t + s)². (4) But (t + s)² = t² + 2ts + s² ≥ 4s² because t ≥ s. Inequality (4) therefore holds, and all the earlier steps are reversible, so the original statement is true. Alternative one-line proof (same idea): (a + b)/2 − √{ab} = (√a − √b)²/2, while (a − b)² /(8b) = (√a − √b)² (√a + √b)² /(8b). Since (√a + √b)² ≥ 4b, division by 8b shows the right-hand side dominates the left-hand side. 4. [Conclusion] Thus for all positive reals with b ≤ a, (a + b)/2 − √(ab) does not exceed (a − b)² /(8b).
