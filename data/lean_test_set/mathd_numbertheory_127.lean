-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the remainder of the geometric sum S = 1 + 2 + 2² + … + 2¹⁰⁰ when divided by 7. 2. [Key Idea] Because 2³ ≡ 1 (mod 7), powers of 2 repeat every three exponents; using the closed‐form geometric sum then reduces the problem to a single power of 2 modulo 7. 3. [Proof] Method 1 (Geometric-series formula) Let S = 1 + 2 + 2² + … + 2¹⁰⁰. Since the ratio is 2 ≠ 1, S = (2¹⁰¹ – 1)/(2 – 1) = 2¹⁰¹ – 1. Compute 2¹⁰¹ (mod 7): 2³ ≡ 8 ≡ 1 (mod 7) 2¹⁰¹ = 2⁹⁹·2² = (2³)³³·4 ≡ 1³³·4 ≡ 4 (mod 7). Hence S ≡ 4 – 1 ≡ 3 (mod 7). Method 2 (Cyclic block summation) Because 2³ ≡ 1 (mod 7), the sequence of powers (mod 7) is 1, 2, 4, then repeats. Group the 101 terms into 33 complete blocks of length 3 plus the first two terms of the next block: Sum of one block: 1 + 2 + 4 ≡ 0 (mod 7). Total from 33 blocks: 33·0 ≡ 0 (mod 7). Remaining terms: 1 + 2 ≡ 3 (mod 7). Therefore S ≡ 3 (mod 7). 4. [Conclusion] The sum 1 + 2 + 2² + … + 2¹⁰⁰ leaves a remainder of 3 upon division by 7.
