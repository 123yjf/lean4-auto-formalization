-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that for every integer n ≥ 9, the quantity ((n + 2)! – (n + 1)!)/n! is always a perfect square. 2. [Key Idea] Factor out n! from the two factorials; the remaining algebra collapses the whole fraction to (n + 1)². 3. [Proof] ((n + 2)! – (n + 1)!)/n! = [(n + 2)(n + 1)n! – (n + 1)n!]/n! = (n + 1)[(n + 2) – 1] = (n + 1)². Since (n + 1)² is the square of the integer n + 1, the given expression is a perfect square. 4. [Conclusion] For every n ≥ 9 (indeed, for every positive integer n), ((n + 2)! – (n + 1)!)/n! equals (n + 1)², hence is always a perfect square, choice (D).
