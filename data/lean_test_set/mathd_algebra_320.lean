-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Solve 2x² = 4x + 9 for the positive x and, when written as (a + √b) / c in simplest form with a, b, c ∈ ℕ, show that a + b + c = 26. 2. [Key Idea] Transform the equation into a quadratic, use the quadratic formula, take the positive root, and read off a, b, c. 3. [Proof] Starting from 2x² = 4x + 9, bring all terms to one side: 2x² − 4x − 9 = 0. Apply the quadratic formula to ax² + bx + c = 0 with a = 2, b = −4, c = −9: x = [4 ± √( (−4)² − 4·2·(−9) )] / (2·2) = [4 ± √(16 + 72)] / 4 = [4 ± √88] / 4 = [4 ± 2√22] / 4 = (2 ± √22) / 2. Because x > 0, select the positive root: x = (2 + √22) / 2. This is already in simplest (lowest-terms) form with a = 2, b = 22, c = 2, so a + b + c = 2 + 22 + 2 = 26. 4. [Conclusion] The positive solution is x = (2 + √22)/2, yielding a + b + c = 26 as required.
