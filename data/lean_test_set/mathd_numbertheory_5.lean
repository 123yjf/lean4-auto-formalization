-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find the least integer > 10 that is simultaneously a perfect square and a perfect cube. 2. [Key Idea] An integer is both a square and a cube exactly when it is a sixth power; the smallest sixth power exceeding 10 is 2⁶. 3. [Proof] Let n be an integer such that n = a² = b³ for some integers a, b. • Writing a = p₁^{α₁}…p_k^{α_k} and b = p₁^{β₁}…p_k^{β_k} in prime form gives n = p₁^{2α₁}…p_k^{2α_k} = p₁^{3β₁}…p_k^{3β_k}. • Hence each exponent must be a common multiple of 2 and 3, i.e. a multiple of 6. Therefore n = c⁶ for some integer c (a sixth power). The sequence of positive sixth powers is 1, 64, 729, …; only 64 exceeds 10 and is minimal. Explicitly 64 = 2⁶ = (2³)² = (2²)³, so it is both a square and a cube. 4. [Conclusion] The smallest integer greater than 10 that is simultaneously a perfect square and perfect cube is 64.
