-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Solve the linear system 3a + b + c = –3, a + 3b + c = 9, a + b + 3c = 19 and show that the product abc equals –56. 2. [Key Idea] Subtracting the equations pairwise quickly reveals simple relations among a, b, c; substituting these relations back into one original equation determines each variable and hence their product. 3. [Proof] Step 1 – Find linear relations. (2) – (1): (a + 3b + c) – (3a + b + c) = 9 – (–3) –2a + 2b = 12 ⇒ –a + b = 6 ⇒ b = a + 6. (3) – (2): (a + b + 3c) – (a + 3b + c) = 19 – 9 –2b + 2c = 10 ⇒ –b + c = 5 ⇒ c = b + 5. Step 2 – Substitute into one equation. Use (1): 3a + b + c = –3. Replace b and c: 3a + (a + 6) + (a + 11) = –3 5a + 17 = –3 5a = –20 a = –4. Step 3 – Compute b and c. b = a + 6 = –4 + 6 = 2 c = b + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7. Step 4 – Product. abc = (–4)(2)(7) = –56. 4. [Conclusion] The unique solution a = –4, b = 2, c = 7 indeed yields abc = –56.
