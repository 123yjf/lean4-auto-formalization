-- ### [Problem Restatement] Prove that for every integer \(n \geq 0\), the sum \(s_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5. ### [Key Idea] Express \(s_n = d_{2n+1}/4\) where \(d_m\) satisfies the recurrence \(d_m = 2d_{m-1} + 7d_{m-2}\) with \(d_1 = 4\), \(d_2 = 8\); then show \(d_m \not\equiv 0 \pmod{5}\) for all odd \(m\) by analyzing the recurrence modulo 5, which is periodic with period 24 and never zero at odd indices. ### [Proof] Let \(N = 2n+1\), so \(s_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{N}{2k+1} 8^k\). Set \(a = 1 + 2\sqrt{2}\), \(b = 1 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Then \(s_n = [a^N - b^N] / (4\sqrt{2})\). Define \(v_N = a^N - b^N = d_N \sqrt{2}\) where \(d_N \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(d_N \equiv 0 \pmod{4}\), so \(s_n = d_N / 4\). The sequence \(d_m\) satisfies \(d_m = 2d_{m-1} + 7d_{m-2}\) with \(d_1 = 4\), \(d_2 = 8\). Since 4 is invertible modulo 5, \(s_n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\) if and only if \(d_N \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\). Modulo 5, the recurrence is \(d_m \equiv 2(d_{m-1} + d_{m-2}) \pmod{5}\) (as \(7 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}\)) with \(d_1 \equiv 4\), \(d_2 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}\). Computing terms shows the sequence modulo 5 is periodic with period 24: 4, 3, 4, 4, 1, 0, 2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 0, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 0, and repeats. The values at odd indices are 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2 (for \(k = 1,3,\dots,23\)), none of which are 0 modulo 5. The zeros occur only at even indices (\(k \equiv 0,6,12,18 \pmod{24}\)). Thus, \(d_N \not\equiv 0 \pmod{5}\) for odd \(N\). #### [Alternative Proof (Induction on Periodicity)] Assume for contradiction there exists smallest odd \(m \geq 1\) with \(d_m \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\). Then \(d_{m-1} + d_{m-2} \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\). Since \(m\) is odd, \(m-1\) even, \(m-2\) odd. Checking small odd \(m\) (up to period 24) shows no such \(m\), and periodicity implies none exist. ### [Conclusion] Thus, \(s_n\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\).
