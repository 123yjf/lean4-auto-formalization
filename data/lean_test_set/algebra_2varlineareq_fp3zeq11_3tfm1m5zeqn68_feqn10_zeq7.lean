-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Solve the linear system f + 3z = 11, 3(f − 1) − 5z = −68. 2. [Key Idea] Use the elimination method: rewrite the second equation, align coefficients, subtract, and solve. 3. [Proof] Rewrite the second equation: 3(f − 1) − 5z = −68 ⇒ 3f − 3 − 5z = −68 ⇒ 3f − 5z = −65. Now solve the system (1) f + 3z = 11 (2) 3f − 5z = −65. Multiply (1) by 3: 3f + 9z = 33. Subtract (2) from this result: (3f + 9z) − (3f − 5z) = 33 − (−65) ⇒ 14z = 98 ⇒ z = 7. Substitute z = 7 into (1): f + 3(7) = 11 ⇒ f + 21 = 11 ⇒ f = −10. 4. [Conclusion] The unique solution to the system is f = −10 and z = 7.
