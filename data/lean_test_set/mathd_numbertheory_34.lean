-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the integer x with 0 ≤ x ≤ 99 such that 9x ≡ 1 (mod 100). 2. [Key Idea] Solve the linear congruence 9x ≡ 1 (mod 100) by using either the extended Euclidean algorithm or a short inspection based on the fact that 100 = 4·25 is close to a multiple of 9. 3. [Proof] Direct computation (inspection). • Note 9·11 = 99 ≡ −1 (mod 100). • Multiply both sides by −1: 9·(−11) ≡ 1 (mod 100). • Reduce −11 modulo 100: −11 ≡ 89 (mod 100). • Hence 9·89 ≡ 1 (mod 100). Extended Euclidean algorithm (formal). Find integers s, t with 9s + 100t = 1. 100 = 11·9 + 1 1 = 100 − 11·9 ⇒ s = −11, so −11 is an inverse of 9. Modulo 100, −11 ≡ 89, giving the same inverse. 4. [Conclusion] The multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89.
