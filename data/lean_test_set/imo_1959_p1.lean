-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Show that 21n + 4 and 14n + 3 share no common divisor larger than 1, i.e. gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = 1 for every n ∈ ℕ. 2. [Key Idea] Any common divisor of two integers divides every integer linear combination of them; finding a combination that equals 1 forces the gcd to be 1. 3. [Proof] Let d = gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3). Compute the following linear combination: 3(14n + 3) − 2(21n + 4) = 42n + 9 − (42n + 8) = 1. Since d divides both 21n + 4 and 14n + 3, it must also divide their combination, which is 1. Therefore d = 1, implying the fraction (21n + 4)/(14n + 3) is already in lowest terms. (Alternate view – Euclidean algorithm) gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = gcd(14n + 3, (21n + 4) − (14n + 3)) = gcd(14n + 3, 7n + 1) = gcd(7n + 1, (14n + 3) − 2(7n + 1)) = gcd(7n + 1, 1) = 1. 4. [Conclusion] Because the greatest common divisor of 21n + 4 and 14n + 3 is always 1, the fraction (21n + 4)/(14n + 3) is irreducible for every natural number n.
