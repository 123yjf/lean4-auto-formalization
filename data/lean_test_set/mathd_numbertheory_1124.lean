-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Determine the units digit n for which the four-digit number 374n is divisible by 18. 2. [Key Idea] A number is divisible by 18 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 9; these give independent, easy-to-check conditions on n. 3. [Proof] Divisibility by 2: ‒ The last digit must be even, so n ∈ {0,2,4,6,8}. Divisibility by 9: ‒ A number is divisible by 9 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. ‒ For 374n, the digit-sum is 3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n. ‒ Require 14 + n ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ n ≡ –14 ≡ –5 ≡ 4 (mod 9). ‒ Among digits 0–9, only n = 4 satisfies this congruence. Combining the two conditions, n = 4 is the unique choice. 4. [Conclusion] The units digit that makes 374n divisible by 18 is n = 4.
