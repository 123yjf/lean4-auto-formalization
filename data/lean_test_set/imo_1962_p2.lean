-- 1. [Problem Restatement] Find all real x for which √(√(3 − x) − √(x + 1)) > ½. 2. [Key Idea] Square once to obtain a simpler inequality, notice the resulting function is strictly decreasing on its domain, and solve the single boundary equation to locate the unique cut-off point. 3. [Proof] (a) Domain. √(3 − x) and √(x + 1) must be real and the inner difference non-negative: 3 − x ≥ 0, x + 1 ≥ 0, √(3 − x) ≥ √(x + 1). Hence −1 ≤ x ≤ 1. (b) First squaring. √(√(3 − x) − √(x + 1)) > ½ ⇔ √(3 − x) − √(x + 1) > ¼. (∗) (c) Boundary point. Let s = √(3 − x), t = √(x + 1) (s,t ≥ 0). Then s − t = ¼ and s² + t² = (3 − x)+(x+1)=4. Substitute s = t+¼ into the second equation: (t+¼)² + t² = 4 2t² + ½t + 1/16 = 4 32t² + 8t − 63 = 0. t = [−8 + 8√127]/64 = (−1 + √127)/8 (only the positive root is admissible). Therefore √(x + 1) = (−1 + √127)/8 x + 1 = (128 − 2√127)/64 = 2 − √127/32 x₀ = 1 − √127/32. (d) Monotonicity. Define f(x)=√(3 − x) − √(x + 1) on [−1,1]. f′(x)=−1/[2√(3 − x)] − 1/[2√(x + 1)] < 0, so f is strictly decreasing. Since f(−1)=2>¼ and f(x₀)=¼, inequality (∗) holds for all x< x₀ and fails for x> x₀. (e) Collecting conditions. Combining −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 with x < x₀ gives the solution set [−1, 1 − √127/32). Alternative glance (geometric). The pair (s,t) lies on the circle s²+t²=4 and above the line s−t=¼; intersection occurs once, yielding the same x₀, and monotonicity again gives the interval to its left. 4. [Conclusion] All real numbers satisfying the inequality are exactly x ∈ [ −1, 1 − √127/32 ).
