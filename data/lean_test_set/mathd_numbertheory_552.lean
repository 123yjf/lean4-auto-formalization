-- 1. [Problem Restatement] For positive integers x, let f(x)=12x+7 and g(x)=5x+2; determine every possible value of h(x)=gcd(f(x),g(x)) and add them together. 2. [Key Idea] Apply the Euclidean algorithm symbolically; the gcd quickly reduces to a constant divisor of 11, so only 1 or 11 can occur, and both do. 3. [Proof] Euclidean-algorithm reduction gcd(12x+7, 5x+2) = gcd(12x+7 − 2(5x+2), 5x+2) = gcd(2x+3, 5x+2) = gcd(5x+2 − 2(2x+3), 2x+3) = gcd(x−4, 2x+3) = gcd(2x+3 − 2(x−4), x−4) = gcd(11, x−4). Hence h(x) divides 11, so h(x) ∈ {1, 11}. Existence • x=1: f(1)=19, g(1)=7 ⇒ h(1)=1. • x=4: f(4)=55, g(4)=22 ⇒ h(4)=11. Thus both values occur. Sum of distinct values: 1+11 = 12. (Alternate modular view) 12x+7 ≡ 0 (mod 11) and 5x+2 ≡ 0 (mod 11) both lead to x ≡ 4 (mod 11); so 11 divides the pair exactly when x ≡ 4 (mod 11), confirming the same two gcd values. 4. [Conclusion] The only possible gcds are 1 and 11, whose sum is 12.
